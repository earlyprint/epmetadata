         <title>A warning to the inhabitants of the earth But more especially to those who say they believe in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, with al those that in the simplicity of their hearts, and tender desires towards God, are seeking the kingdom of heaven, (in several forms, and divers observations) with their faces thitherwards; the Lord has opened his bowels of love and tender compassion (through me) towards you all; and these are the words that are laid upon me to give forth, that in the name, fear, dread and power of the living God, they may be read amoungst you. He that can receive them let him.</title>
