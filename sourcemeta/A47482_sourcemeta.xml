         <note>An answer to Matthew Smith's "A reply to an unjust and scandalous libel intituled, A modest answer to Captain Smith's immodest Memoirs," which was written by Kingston in the controversy which began with Smith's Memoirs of secret service. Kingston held Thomas Brown at least in part responsible for Smith's writings, but he had little, if anything, to do with the controversy. Cf. DNB.</note>
