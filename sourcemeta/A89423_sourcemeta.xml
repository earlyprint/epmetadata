      <title>Another word to the wise, shewing that the delay of justice, is great injustice. By displaying heavier grievances in petitions from severall counties to the House of Commons and letters to Parlament men, from Mr. John Musgrave Gentleman, one of the commissioners from Cumberland and Westmerland, for presenting their grievances to the Parliament. Who instead either of redressing those two counties grievances, or prosecuting the charge given in by him against Mr. Richard Barwis, a Parliament man, ... did illegally commit the said Mr John Musgrave to the Fleet, where he hath lain these 4. moneths, without any justice, on tryall of his businesse. ...</title>
