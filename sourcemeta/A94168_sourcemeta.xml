      <title>The false brother, or, A new map of Scotland, drawn by an English pencil; being a short history of the political and civil transactions between these two nations since their first friendship: wherein the many secret designs, and dangerous aspects and influences of that nation on England are discovered; with the juglings of their commissioners with the late King, Parliament, and city. The grounds of the entrance of our army into Scotland cleared, from their own principles and actings; their main pleas impleaded, and answered. Humbly presented to the Councel of State.</title>
