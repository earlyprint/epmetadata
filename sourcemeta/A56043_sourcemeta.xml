         <title>A warning to England with a hand of true pity and compassion still held forth in the love God, to call you all to repentance, that have not repented of your wickedness, and horrible provoking sins, wherewith you have provoked the Lord, and kindled his wrath more and more against you : wherein is shewed the great danger that you are in who hate the light of Christ Jesus, and put his day afar off from you : as also, something is signified of the great woes and heavy judgments, that have been , and shortly will come upon the people of this nation, that do not repent, and turn to the Lord while they have time, and some objections briefly answered, to satisfie the true seeker after the way of God.</title>
