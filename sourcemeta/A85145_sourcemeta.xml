      <title>The pure language of the spirit of truth, set forth for the confounding false languages, acted out of pride, ambition, and deceit. Or, thee and thou, in its place is the proper language to any single person whatsoever. Proved by several examples, that is herein laid down by plain Scripture, for the convinceing, and stopping the mouths of gainsayers: many more examples might have been laid down, but what is herein mentioned and proved by Scriptures are sufficient for the same.</title>
