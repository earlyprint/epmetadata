         <title>Irelands tragical tyrannie sent over in two letters, by a speehlesse [sic] damzell, which landed at Miniard upon the 18 day Jan. 1642 : wherein is plainly and truly shown, what cruelty hath possess the Irish rebels hearts, and how barbarously they have dealt with her : first how they defloured her body, and after tore the haire from her head, and lastly how they cut out her tongue and one of her hands for resisting them : also, how the wolves destroyed Mr. Thomas Adams, his wife and children, to the number of fourteen persons in one night, being constrained to forsake their habitation : with a true relation of other remarkable passages performed by the blood-thirsty rebels / these letters were sent from the damzels father out of Ireland, to her Uncle Robinson, who liveth neere unto Miniard in Summerset-shire.</title>
