         <title>Englands miserie, if not prevented by the speedie remedie of a happie union between His Maiestie and this Parliament. By His Majesties concurrance with them, to discard all false flattering Achitophel-cavaliers, proud ambitious prelates, and blood-suck thirsting church papists, as well as profest, about His Majesties sacred person and councels. Written by a well-wisher to His King and countrey. Together with the copie of a letter sent from a friend in Lancashire, to a gentleman in Grays-Inne-Lane. As also an order from both Houses of Parliament to the sheriffs of York and Lincolnshire for suppressing of forces that disturbe the peace of the kingdom. Jo. Brown, Cler. Parl.</title>
