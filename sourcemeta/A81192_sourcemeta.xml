         <note>"The author of the Trip to Holland" in the above title prepared a 1697 edition of Owen Felltham's "Batavia: or the Hollanders display'd" (originally published in 1672; Wing F647C), to which, according to the contents of the work being catalogued here, he added "two sheets and an half" and called it "A trip to Holland, because a certain scurrilous nonsensical pamphlet had sold well under the name of a trip", i.e. "A trip to Jamaica" by Edward Ward (1698; Wing W763). It is possible that the copies reported at Wing F659 and F659A, i.e. "A trip to Holland", include both this work, laudatory to the Netherlands, and the "scurrilous nonsensical pamphlet" of the same title.</note>
         <note>A reply to "A trip to Holland", the scurrilous satire referred to above. Our anonymous author clearly believes it to be by Edward Ward, since in his text he alludes to "the fiery plantation author", referring to Ward's "A trip to Jamaica" and names Ward's printer, "J. How", the printer of that work</note>
         <note>Actual date of publication from Wing.</note>
