      <title>[News] from Epsom: or, The revengful lady shewing how a young lady there was beguil'd by a London-gallant; who when he had done, boasted of the conquest, for which unworthy fact, she wittily reveng'd her self of the tell-tale; and made a capon of a Cockney. A novell. Written (tho' I say it) according to the exactest rules of fancy and judgement: in the imitation of Monsieur Scarron. By Poor-Robin, kt. Vindeita.</title>
