         <title>The merry mans resolution or, His last farewell to his former acquaintance, declaring how hee rambled up and down, through all the suburbs of fair London town, where pretty wenches hee did plenty find, but some of them agreed not with his mind, till at the last by chance hee found out one, which pleas'd him best, so left the rest alone, to her hee then cling'd close as I heard tell, made her his mate and bid the rest farewell. To a gallant new tune, called the Highlanders new rant.</title>
