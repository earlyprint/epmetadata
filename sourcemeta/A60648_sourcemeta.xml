         <title>A new primmer, wherein is demonstrated the new and living way held forth by way of question and answer, as from a child's enquiry after truth, to be informed by the father. Here being divers particulars answer'd, and plainly opened, that may be profitable both in this present age, and ages to come. Published for the benefit of all sorts of people, and may be very serviceable for every family, and of great use for young children to learn in, so soon as they can understand their language, that they in the fear of God may be instructed, and remember their creator in the dayes of their youth. For which I travel, enduring affliction for the truths sake, William Smith.</title>
