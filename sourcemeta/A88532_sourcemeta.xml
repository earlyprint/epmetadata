      <title>A looking-glas for the Presbitary government, establishing in the Church of England. Or, A declaration of the revolution of the times, pithily composed and seasonably recommended to the view of all sorts of people, but principally to the judicious reformers of the church and state. Look in this glasse you'l not think't strange, England once more receives a change. Of Scotlands government, you'l have a view, and Englands Presbitary which is new. As in a glasse you here may see, the king: the kingdomes misery. The crown resign'd, religion suffers, by pride, ambition, and selfe lovers.</title>
