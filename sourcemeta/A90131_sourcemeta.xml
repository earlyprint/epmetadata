         <title>Old popery in a new dress of presbyterie, or, A parallel between popery and presbytery in the means used to gain an undue and exorbitant power, as likewise in the exercise of it when attained : cleerly discovering a national presbytery, as well as popery, to be inconsistent with the due exercise of the civill power, in the hands of those who are invested with it : which may also serve to evince the prudentiality of a non-toleration of a general kirk-assembly in Scotland.</title>
