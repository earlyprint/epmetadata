         <title>The sacramental stumbling-block removed. Or a brief discourse concerning examination by the congregational eldership, before admittance to the sacrament. Wherein all contrary scruples are silenced : the equity and necessity of that duty vindicated, both by scripture, and undenyable arguments. Set forth for, 1. The satisfaction of the weake. 2. The information of the ignorant. 3. The conviction of the obstinate. 4. The edification of the Church of God. / by W.L.</title>
