      <title>Strange-predictions related at Catericke in the north of England: by one who saw a vision, and told it himselfe to the company with whom he was drinking healths; how he was struck, and an angel appeared to him with a sword. A revelation made to him; and the whole narrative of the same. Certified by a letter from an eminent person.</title>
