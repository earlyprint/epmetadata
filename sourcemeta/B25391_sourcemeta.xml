      <title>A just and modest vindication of the many thousand loyal apprentices that presented an humble address to the Lord Mayor of London: in which is manifested the reason, why they engaged themselves in such an affair: and, that they have so great a veneration and esteem for parliaments, because they are the wisest, best and safest counsellors any prince can consult and confide in, for redressing the grievances of the nation, and to make himself and his kingdom happy: as is clearly though briefly evinced in the following discourse.</title>
