         <title>Londons drollery: or, The love and kindness between the Pope and the Devil. Manifested by some true Protestants, who utterly defie the Pope and his Romish faction; as it was to be seen in London, November the 17th. 1680. With nine pagents delightful to behold. The tune is, All you that do desire to play, at cards to pass the time away.</title>
