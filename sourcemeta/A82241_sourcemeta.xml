         <title>A declaration of the well-affected common-councel-men of the City of London, in the name of themselvs, and the inhabitants thereof, concerning the injustice and oppression which is unequally cast and laid upon the distressed citizens. Wherein they remonstrate a speedy and just way, for the taking off of all heavy burdens relieving the oppressed, the mitigating of taxes and assesments, and laying it upon rich marchants, and others, who are able to bear it, to the end that those who have bin oppressed may now go free. Extracted out of the original, and published according to order; to the end, that all cities and townes within this nation, may take it as a president for their future ease and freedome, against all oppressours whatsoever.</title>
