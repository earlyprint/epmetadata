      <title>The speech of Collonel John Sares, delivered at the place of execution on the tenth of this instant month at Chester: with his protestation, that if he had a head of hair as big as Absolon, and every hair as strong as Sampson, he would spend them all for the good and honour of his king. Likewise, the charge of high treason read against him at the bar, for adhering to Charles the II, and his declaration upon the ladder: together with his tryumphant speech when the rope was put over his neck, saying; what a gallant mourning ribbon is this, which I wear for the true loyalty I bear to my king.</title>
