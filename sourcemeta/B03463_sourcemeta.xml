         <title>The good Christians complaint; or, Poor charity's languishing lamentation in a late long and tedious winter; seeing pride, envy, hatred, malice, with many other vices, nourish'd like darlings in the bosome of mankind; whilst love and mercy, truth and charity, did unregarded wander like strange pilgrims. Concluding with a seasonable exhortation to a Christian life. / Licensed according to order.</title>
