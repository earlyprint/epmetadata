         <title>A manifestation from Lieutenant Col. John Lilburn, Mr. William Walwyn, Mr. Thomas Prince, and Mr. Richard Overton (now prisioners in the Tower of London) and others, commonly (though unjustly) styled Levellers : intended for full vindication from the many aspersions cast upon them, to render them odious to the world, and unserviceable to the Common-wealth, and to satisfie and ascertain all men whereunto all their motions and endeavours tend, and what is the ultimate scope of their engagement in the publick affaires : they also that render evill for good, are our adversaries, because we follow the thing that good is.</title>
