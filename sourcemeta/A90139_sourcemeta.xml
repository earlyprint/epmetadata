      <title>Oliver Cromwell the late great tirant and his life-guard: or The names of those who compiled and conspired with him all along in his horrid designs to bring this nation to vniversal ruine and confusion. Together with, a proper and peculiar character of every one of the persons, suitable to their barbarous actions, and the several inclinations of their most violent and greedy natures. As also the covenant which they took, and the eminent danger into which they had brought both state and church, and the miraculous mercies of God in delivering us from them by restoring unto us our most gracious King, whom God send long to reign over us.</title>
