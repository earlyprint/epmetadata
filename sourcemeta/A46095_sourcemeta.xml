         <title>An Impartial account of the doctrines of the church of Rome viz : the pope's supremacy, his infallibility, his power of indulgence, the lawfulness of equivocation, no faith to be kept with hereticks that the pope hath power to declare heresie and who are hereticks, that he may excommunicate emperours kings and princes &amp;c. : shewing what Rome was in its pristine purity : and how it hath degenerated in the several centuries by ushering in those horrid innovations : proved from their own authors : in a letter to a friend in the countrey.</title>
