         <title>A true discovery of those treasons of which Geilis Van Ledenberch was a practiser against the generall states of the Vnited Netherland Provinces through the aduise, and assistance of Iohn van Olden Barneuelt. And for which (after arraignment, sentence and iudgement) execution was done on the dead body of the said Ledenberch, after he had most inhumanly murthered himselfe, through the guiltines, and horror of his conscience. As also a copy of Barneuelts last letter to his wife, and children.</title>
