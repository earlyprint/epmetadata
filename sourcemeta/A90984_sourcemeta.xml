         <title>A new dialogue between Dick of Kent, and Wat the Welch-man. Filled up with many pretty conceits, written and printed on purpose to make folks merry in time of sadnesse. / By Laurence Price. This new conceited book will move delights, and serve to passe away some dolesome dayes, also the tedious melancholy nights, for in the same is many a pretty phrase. No harm at all is in't but mirth and joy, then buy it first, then bear't with you away.</title>
