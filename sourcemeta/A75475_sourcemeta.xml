         <note>"This was undoubtedly written in the autumn of 1644 but was received by Thomason on April 30, 1645: so either it was long in reaching Thomason, or, as is more probable, there was delay in printing and publishing the book, and the "1644" on the title page was never altered"--Madan.</note>
