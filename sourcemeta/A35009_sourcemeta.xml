      <title>The first part of Babel's-builders unmasking themselves as appears by the following judgment from Barbadoes (promoted by George Fox his party, and subscribed by eighty two of them) : with a letter of G.F.'s, G.W's, &amp;c. in answer thereunto, and observations thereupon : also a false prophesie of that lying prophet, Sol. Eccles : whereas the following discourse was formerly printed and privately disposed ... amongst those called Quakers, but finding some of G.F.'s party have since publickly exposed it with slanderous and false charges on the author, this second impression with some small addition, is now made publick ... / Thomas Crisp.</title>
