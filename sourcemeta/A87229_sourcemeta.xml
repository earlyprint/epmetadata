      <title>The great case of conscience opened: in the particular unfolding, and examination of those two difficult texts, in Mat. 5.33,34. and Jam. 5.12. about the lawfulness or unlawfulness of swearing: wherein the evidence of Scripture-light, as laid down in the Old and New Testament, in variety of cases and examples (not hitherto insisted on) are succinctly and clearly stated; and usefully accommodated &amp; suited to the present state and condition of many suffering Christians.
