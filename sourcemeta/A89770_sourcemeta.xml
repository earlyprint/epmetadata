         <title>Nottinghamshires petition to the King: humbly imploring his sacred Majesty to returne and joyne with both his Houses of Parliament, being delivered by them personally to His Majesty the 30 day of August, opening therein the manifold dangers this distracted kingdome is like to fall into by reason of his Majesties withdrawing his splendent beams of comfort from both his Houses of Parliament. Also a petition presented unto his Majesty for the taking downe of his standard. Likewise a relation of the misdemeanors of some of the cavalliers towards the petitioners, and how thereby they were like to fall on both sides to a dangerous skirmish.</title>
