      <title>The Faithfull narrative of the late testimony and demand made to Oliver Cromwel, and his powers, on the behalf of the Lords prisoners, in the name of the Lord Jehovah (Jesus Christ,) king of saints and nations. Published by faithful hands, members of churches (out of the original copies) to prevent mistakes, and misreports thereupon. To the faithful remnant of the Lamb, who are in this day of great rebuke and blasphemy, ingaged against the beast and his government, especially, to the new non-conforming churches, and saints in city and country, commonly called by the name of fifth monarchy men.</title>
