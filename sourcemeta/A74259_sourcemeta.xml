         <title>An exact and true relation, of the wonderful vvhirle-vvind, on Saturday, June the 2. about 4. of the clock in the afternoone at Worthington, and Worthington-Hall, and at Tongue, and some other places in the county of Leicester. As also, the terrible devastation that it made in beating downe many trees and houses, and with a sudden violence stripping naked many great okes, and plucking their barkes from their bodies; as also taking away a hive of bees, and great store of linnen, which could never since be heard of. Together with the miraculous mercy of God in preserving many men, women, and children, who were desperatly involved in that dreadfull danger. Very necessary to be read. Attested by Colonell Tho: Ragge, and Major Fran. Beniskin of Tongue, to whom the said hive of bees belonged; and by many thousands of others, whose names are too many to be here incerted.</title>
