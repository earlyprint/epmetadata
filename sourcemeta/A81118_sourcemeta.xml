      <note>Wing attributes to Arthur Culme, whose name appears on title page as the deliverer of the newsletter to Parliament. However, this text was also published in the same year as part of "An exact and full relation of the great victory obtained against the rebels at Dungons-Hill in Ireland, August 8. 1647. by the forces under the command of Colonel Michael Jones" (Wing R2068). In that edition, the letter is signed: Matt. Rowe.</note>
      <note>The last leaf bears "A list of the prisoners taken at the Battaile of Dungan-Hill, August 8. 1647" on verso. This list is also printed in Wing  R2068.</note>
