         <title>A looking-glass for a Christian family; or, A warning for all people to serve God. Good people, in this glass you may behold the joy and comfort the godly are in, the wicked being accursed for evermore: likewise the great cause the Lord sends such sore judgements among us for our sins and wickedness, and worser he will send if we repent not in time. The tune is, Aim not too high.</title>
