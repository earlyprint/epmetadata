         <title>The Quakers house built upon the sand. Or, A discovery of the damnablenesse of their pernicious doctrines With a warning to the people of God, and all others that tender the salvation of their immortall soules, to build upon the rocke Christ Jesus, and his righteousnesse, to confirm the faith once delivered to the saints. In answer to a rayling pamphlet, lately put forth by George Whithead. This is published for the securing the saints, keeping others out of the snare, and (if possible) the reducing some of those that have been seduced by their destructive principles. By the unworthyest of the labourers in the Lords vineyard, and teacher to a church of Christ, Samuel Hammond.</title>
