      <title>Laying on of hands asserted: or, A plain discovery of the truth thereof under those several considerations, minded in the New Testament. 1. Upon persons for healing: with a brief discovery of that ordinance of Christ, (to wit) anointing with oile. 2. Upon persons to office. 3. Upon believers, baptized, as such: and that principle of Christs doctrine cleared, for their obedience: with objections answered to each particular. To which is annexed, a confutation of four chapters written by some person, or persons, in opposition to this principle of the doctrine of Christ, (to wit) laying on of hands upon believers baptized, as such; wherein the weakness of their reasons against the truth, is plainly discovered, and the truth further asserted, and vindicated. By VVilliam Rider, servant to the Church of Christ.</title>
