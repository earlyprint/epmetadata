         <title>The Independents dream, of a new-nothing, called a church, without either government, doctrine or manners, suitable to the Gospell of Jesus Christ: zealously interpreted, by a Christian brother, who is a profest enemy to confusion. Shewing how the Independent-dreaming teachers, through the spectacles of phantasie, discover strange new-lights, and new-born truths, wherewith they delude the hearts of the simple, and allure them into the labyrinth of their innovated traditionall forme of godlinesse.</title>
