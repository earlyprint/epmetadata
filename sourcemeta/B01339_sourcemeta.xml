      <title>A new prognostication, for the year of our redemption, 1678, being the second after bissextile, or leap year. Most curiously and artificially calculated, for all north-Brittain, but more especially (and even according to every typographer's very bound duty) for the latitude and meridian of our most famous city of Bon-Accord. Which stands upon a pleasant lone, whose gallant dykes, are Dee and Done. / by A. R. A.M. an expert mathematician.</title>
