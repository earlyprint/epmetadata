         <title>A warning to the court, Parliament, and army. From a true lover of his country, and of all that love the truth in righteousness. Heartily desiring the peace and welfare of these poore nations, with freedome and an impartial administration of justice, that righteousness might run down our streets like a flood, and truth be exalted. Then will our God crown the labourers in, and doers of His work, with glory and honour, and at last immortality.</title>
