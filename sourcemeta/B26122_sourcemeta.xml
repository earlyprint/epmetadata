      <title>Laun&#230;us redivivus: or, A true narrative of the admirable effects of Delaun's pill that ancient &amp; excellant Galenick medicine, approved of, and sold for above fifty years, in Black-Fryers, now newly reviv'd, and exposed to sale, at the signe of Delaun's Head there, for the good of all, by especially the poor, whose purses reach not to whole boxes or bottles of physick. For, the patient is not now obliged to expend above six pence to prove the operation of this peerless pill; one being a sufficient dose for most constitutions: yet is above twice as costly, and but half the purchase of any other. With some reflexions on the danger of mercurial medicines, practis'd and invented by ignorant and impudent empericks. As also, a short discourse and description of the scurvy, dropsie, venereal, and other distempers. By Nathaniel Lomax, student in physick.</title>
