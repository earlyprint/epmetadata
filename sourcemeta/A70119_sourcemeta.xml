         <title>The Good old cause explained, revived, &amp; asserted and the Long-Parliament vindicated in a remonstrance to His Excellency the Lord Fleetwood and councel of officers : being the sense and earnest desires of many thousands honest well-affected persons of the army and people in this nation : with several expedients humbly offered, 1. for the settling and securing of our civil and spiritual rights and freedoms, and the publique peace of the nation, 2. for the speedy raising of moneys to pay the arrears of the army and navy, and future supply of other publique ingagements, as the most probable and visible way and means now under God left to accomplish the same, and preserves us from that inevitable confusion and destruction which hangs over and threatens the three nations.</title>
