         <title>The cloudie clergie, or, A mourning lecture for our morning lecturers intended for a weekly antidote against the daily infection of those London preachers, who de die in diem do corrupt the judgments of their seduced auditors, against the governours and government of the common-wealth of England, grounded upon received aphorismes, digested into chapters, fit to be considered by those froward [sic] chaplins that have been the Quondam Beautefews against the late King of England, and are the present beadsmen for the now King of Scotland : the like whereof they may expect from week to week, while they abuse the Parliament and army from day to day / by a friend, who for their timous recovery doth cri in hope.</title>
