         <title>Loves triumph over bashfulness: or, The pleas of honour and chastity over-ruled. Being a pleasant new play-song by way of dialogue between Celia and Strephon. When love takes up his arms, all force must yield, he will be victor, his must be the field: vain is resistance, no force could e're withstand the swift-wing'd shafts sent by his nimble hand: Celia brings honour, chastity and fame, not dreaming but they can resist the same; but that they were not proof the nymph soon found, for through them all, love did her bosome wound. To a pleasant new play-house tune.</title>
