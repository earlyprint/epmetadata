         <title>Greenes carde of fancie Wherein the folly of those carpet knights is deciphered, which guiding their course by the compass of Cupid, either dash their ship against most dangerous rocks, or else attaine the haven with pain and perill. Wherein also is described in the person of Gwydonius a cruell combate between nature and necessitie. By Robert Green, Master of Art, in Cambridge.</title>
