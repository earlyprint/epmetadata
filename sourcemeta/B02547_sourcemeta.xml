      <title>Cupid's master-piece: or, Long wisht for comes at last: or, the happy meeting of William and Mary. A pretty damsel of sixteen 'tis said, was courted; but of love she was afraid: she slights sweet William (so she call'd his name) he took her first repulse; then she with shame, laments her scornful folly: now she loves, and languishes with grief, till Cupid moves her William once again for to be kind; which soon he did perform: now both are joyn'd in love's strict mutual bands, and marryed, let none, though once deny'd, in love despair. Tune of Caelia's my foe.</title>
