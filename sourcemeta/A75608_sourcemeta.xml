         <title>The arraignment, conviction, and imprisoning, of Christmas: on St. Thomas day last. And how he broke out of prison in the holidayes and got away, onely left his hoary hair, and gray beard, sticking between two iron bars of a window. With, an hue and cry after Christmas, and a letter from Mr. Woodcock a fellow in Oxford, to a malignant lady in London. And divers passages, between the lady and the cryer, about old Christmas: and what shift he was fain to make to save his life, and great stir to fetch him back again. With other divers witty passages.</title>
