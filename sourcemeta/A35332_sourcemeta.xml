         <title>Good news from Ireland being a true and faithful account of a late signal victory gain'd by our English forces near Dublin : together with a report of the taking of that strong city Drogheda, and the speedy advancing of our army from thence towards Dublin : as also an account of the taking of several vessels, and abundance of horses from the enemy, of which the very horse King James rid on in the fight was one, which is now brought to High-lake, with several other things of great moment : in a letter directed from an officer in the fight, to Mr. John Cook at the sheers in Little Lumbard street, where the true copy is to be seen.</title>
