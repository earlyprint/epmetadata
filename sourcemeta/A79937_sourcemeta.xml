         <title>Clement, the blessed Paul's fellow-labourer in the Gospel, his first epistle to the Corinthians: being an effectuall suasory to peace, and brotherly condescension, after an unhappy schism and separation in that Church. From whence the understanding reader may receive satisfaction concerning the businesse of episcopacy, or presbytery, as it stood in the age of the Apostles, and some time after. The ancient'st writing the Church hath, and the onely extant to that purpose, next to the divinely-inspired Scriptures. And being made good use of, may prove a remedy against the breaches and sad divisions of these distracted churches and times.</title>
