         <title>A lamentable representation of the effects of the present toleration. Especially as to the increase of blasphemy and damnable errours by the liberty of teaching and printing of them, to the great damage of religion, and the provoking the Lord Jesus to destroy the present government, and to inflict ruine and desolation upon these nations. Together with a proposal of some good work for Christian legislators. Humbly laid at the feet of His Highness the Lord Protector, and every member of the High Court of Parliament. / By a friend of true reformation, and his native countrey.</title>
