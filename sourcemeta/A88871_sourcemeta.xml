      <title>Considerations concerning common fields, and inclosures, dialoguewise, digested into a deliberative discourse between two supposed friends, Philopeustus and Parrhesiastes. And tending partly to state and determine the question of lawfulnesse or unlawfulnesse between inclosures, and common fields, partly to answer some passages, which may be thought to make against inclosure in general, in another discourse lately published by Mr John Moore, under this title, The crying sinne of England, of not caring for the poor.</title>
