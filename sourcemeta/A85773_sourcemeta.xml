      <title>New-Englands vindidation [sic]. Shewing the mis-understanding of the apprehension to take all that vast countrey under the notion of a particular place of one pattent of Boston, the metropolitan of the Machechusets there, who in these late times have acted as a free state and illegal proceeding, as by the many books and complaints by petition have caused an odium on the countrey in general, in vindication to manifest the worth of the countrey in general, it is as hopeful to enlarge His Majesties dominions, as if all the Baltick seas were annexed to his empire. By Henry Gardener merchant, whose father was one of the first adventurers thither, and into other parts of America.</title>
