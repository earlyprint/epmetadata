         <note>Dedication initialed: T.S. of V., i.e. Thomas Scott of Utrecht.</note>
         <note>The title page is engraved.</note>
         <note>A forgery of STC 22103.7, printed by William Jones (STC). The title page has a donkey litter to the left of Gondomar's head, with motto "Simul complectar omina [sic]". D3v line 1 begins "of Buckinghams ..".</note>
         <note>Structure of first quires is obscure. A1 (title page) is followed by dedication (a 2-leaf insert signed [&#178; ]A1-2); A2 has illustration and beginning of text. Leaves continue "A3", unsigned, B1-3. STC says the unsigned leaf is B1 and B2-4 are missigned 1-3, in which case &#185;A4 is unaccounted for and apparently cancelled. Pagination is continuous. Quire F should be bound 4, 1, 2, 3.</note>
