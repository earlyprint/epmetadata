      <title>A call to back-sliding Israel and may be as a necessary word of caution and admonition to the inhabitants of East and West-Jarsey, Pennsilvania, &amp;c. as a remembrancer to them to call to mind their former state, and whence they are fallen. With some short account of my leaving a second time that party of them called Quakers, which have condemned G. Keith, and all that own him, or his testimony for the crucified Jesus, our alone advocate in heaven. By Elias Burling.</title>
