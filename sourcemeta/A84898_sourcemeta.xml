      <note>Divers soldiers have entered houses, exacting money and victuals contrary to a proclamation forbidding it on pain of death. Soldiers offending are to be secured by the guard and brought to Whitehall. No soldier is to enter houses or seize any person without warrant from a commissioned officer. They must give their name and company if asked -- Cf. Steele.</note>
