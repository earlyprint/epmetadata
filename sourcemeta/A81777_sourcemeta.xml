         <title>The second part of the Royal oake: or, The royall pilgrimage of His sacred Majestie King Charles II. Communicating divers of His Maiesties persecutions, as well amongst his professed enemies as his pretended friends, perjured servants, and traiterous subjects. Wherein the eminent mercies of Almighty, God are found to be sacredly evident over his anointed person, through the desolate walks which he hath made, since the year of grace 1645, to this present year of his most joyful return, 1660. being full fiftteen years. Together with his deliverances from some late plots, practised as well immediatly against his sacred person, as at further distances, when opportunity should be offered; being the inventions of wicked men, whose fears had brought them into despair, which blessings and deliverances are marked by figures in the margent.</title>

         <note>Wing attributes to John Danvers, who wrote "The royal oake, or, An historical description of the royal progress, wonderful travels, miraculous, escapes, and strange accidents of his sacred Majesty Charles the II (Wing D237). However, the style and tone of the work here being catalogued is very different from Danvers' work. Another candidate for part 1 is "The royal pilgrimage, or The progresse and travels of King Charles the Second, through the most and greatest courts of Europe" (Wing R2142), but again tone and style seem to be wrong.</note>
         <note>Also published later in the same year in Edinburgh with title: The royal pilgrimage of His sacred Majesty King Charles the Second (Wing R2142A).</note>
