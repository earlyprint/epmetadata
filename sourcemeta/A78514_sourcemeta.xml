         <title>The seventh-day SabbathÂ· Or a brief tract on the IV. Commandment. Wherein is discovered the cause of all our controversies about the Sabbath-day, and the meanes of reconciling them. More particularly is shewed 1. That the seventh day from the creation, which was the day of Gods rest, was not the seventh day which God in this law commanded his people to keep holy; neither was it such a kinde of day as was the Jewes Sabbath-day. 2. That the seventh day in this law commanded to be kept holy, is the seventh day of the week, viz. the day following the six dayes of labour with all people. 3. That Sunday is with Christians as truly the Sabbath-day, as was Saterday with the Jewes. / By Thomas Chafie parson of Nutshelling.</title>
