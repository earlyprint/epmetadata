      <title>An experimental index of the heart, or, Self-knowledge in which (as in a looking-glasse) the civillest of men may see what need they have of a redeemer : and that it most deeply concerns them with all speed to sue out their pardon in Christ and to rely wholly and only upon free-grace for pardon and salvation : except they prefer an everlasting furnace of fire and brimstone in hell, before an eternal weight of super-abundant glory in heaven, as all (most sottishly) do that by sinne and Satan are bewitched / drawn up and published for the good of all by R. Younge of Roxwell in Essex, Florilegus.</title>
