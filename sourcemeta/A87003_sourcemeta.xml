         <title>The worlds timely warning-peece newly corrected and amended. This being the third time presented or sent to these three nations, England, Scotland, and Ireland; describing the nearnesse of the day of the Lord, by the signes and tokens that our Saviour told his disciples should come to passe, before the last day. Being a dismall looking-glasse for the false prophets of these times to look into, which invent false imaginations, out of their own proud phantasticall brains, to deceive the simple.
