         <title>A most execrable and barbarous murder done by an East-Indian devil, or a native of Java-Major, in the road of Bantam, aboard an English ship called the Coster, on the 22. of October last, 1641. Wherein is shewed how the wicked villain came to the said ship and hid himself till it was very dark, and then he mudrdered [sic] all the men that were a board, except the cooke, and three boyes. And lastly, how the murderer himselfe was justly requited. Captain William Minor being an eye-witnesse of this bloudy massacre.</title>
