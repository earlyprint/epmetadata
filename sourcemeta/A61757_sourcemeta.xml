      <title>Strange and wonderful news from Bristol being a true relation, how several sheep were found killed near that city, their bellies being ript open, and their fat only taken out of them, all the rest of the carcass being left entire, in order (as it is to be feared) to the kindling more dreadful fires, for carrying on the horrid and damnable Popish Plot and conspiracy for the destruction of His Majesty, and the Protestant religion and government now establisht by law : together, with the examinations taken thereupon, before Sir John Lloyd Mayor, Sir Robert Cann, Mr. Alderman Yates, Capt. William Bedloe, and Sheriff Jackson, and many other of the most eminent citizens of Bristol.</title>
