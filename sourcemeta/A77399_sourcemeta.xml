      <title>A briefe and true relation of the great disorders and riot attempted and committed upon the house of Thomas Hubbert Esquire, (one of His Maiesties justices of the peace for the county of Middlesex) in Moore-fields on the 21. day of March last, (being the Lords day.) And of the chiefe passages and occurrences concerning the same, set forth and published by the said justice, for the better satisfying of misinformed people. And vindicating the city apprentices from the scandalous aspersion cast upon them, of being either the first promoters of it, or chiefe actors in it.</title>
