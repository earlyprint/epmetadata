         <title>The Lord Mayors fare-vvell, from the office of Mayoraltie which was sent to him in a letter, by one of those who are usually (but unjustly) called Anabaptists: wherein he is taxed not only for breach of promise, in not endeavouring to procure of the Parliament one of the City temples, for a publique disputation between the Anabaptists, and the Presbyterians; but likewise for presenting an unjust remonstrance to the Parliament, for procuring licence and authority, to suppresse both Anabaptists, separatists, and all such as have good grounds and principles for their practice.</title>
