         <title>The children's example. Shewing how one Mrs Johnson's child of Barnet, was tempted by the Devil to forsake God, and follow the ways of other wicked children, who used to swear, tell lies, and disobey their parents: how this pretty innocent child resisting Satan, was comforted by an angel from heaven, who warned her of her approaching death: together with her dying words, desiring young children not to forsake God, least Satan would gain power over them.</title>
