      <title>A great conspiracy of the papists, against the worthy members of both Houses of Parliament. And also against the City of London, and generally the whole kingdome. Discovered by divers wicked and bloody letters, which by Gods providence came to light, and was read in the House of Commons the 10. and 11. of January, 1641. With the names of those honourable and worthy members in Parliament. Whose lives they conspire against, and seeke to take away.</title>
