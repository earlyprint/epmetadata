      <title>Newes from More-lane; or, A mad knavish an [sic] vncivil frolick of a tapster dwelling there who buying a fat coult for eighteen pnce [sic], the mare being dead, &amp; he not knowing how to bring the coult up by hand, killed it and had it baked in a pastie, and invited many of his neighbours to the feast; and telling of them what it was; the conceit thereof made them all sick: as by this following ditty you shall hear. The tapster fil'd the cup up to the brim, and all to make the little coult to swim; but all that heares it, sayes that for his gaine, he is no better than a wagg in graine. The tune is, A health to the best of men.</title>
