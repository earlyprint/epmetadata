      <title>A holy commonwealth, or Political aphorisms, opening the true principles of government: for the healing of the mistakes, and resolving the doubts, that most endanger and trouble England at this time: (if yet there may be hope.) And directing the desires of sober Christians that long to see the kingdoms of this world, become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ. / Written by Richard Baxter at the invitation of James Harrington Esquire. With a preface to them that have caused our eclipses since 1646. And a sounder answer to the healing question. And the Jesuites method for restoring popery.</title>
