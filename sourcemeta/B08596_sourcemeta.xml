      <title>A declaration to all the world of our faith, and what we believe who are called Quakers. And this is written, that all people upon Earth may know by whom, and how we are saved, and hopes for eternal life; and what we believe concerning God, Christ and the spirit, and of the things that are eternal, appertaining to all man-kind to know and believe.  Also what ministers and magistrates we own, and what, and whom we deny.</title>
