      <title>The execution of the Popish lord: or, The traytor's downfall Being an account of the beheading of VVilliam Viscount Stafford for high treason: on the 29th. of this instant December, 1680. On a scaffold erected for that purpose, on Tower-hill: with many particulars most remarkable, that happened therein. And of the disposal of his body after execution. Which may be a large warning to all the yet remaining Popish conspirators; how they seek to take away the life of the King, and by seeking to destroy the Protestant religion, have hopes to plant Popery once more in England.</title>
