         <title>To Mr. Thomas Edwards. Sir you stand as one professing your selfe to be instructed by Christ with abilities from God, to throw downe errour, and therefore to that end doe preach every third day, may it therefore please you and those that imploy you in that worke, to give those leave whom you so brand, as bubliquely to object against what you say, when your sermon is ended, as you declare your selfe: and vve hope it will be an encrease of further light to all that feare God and put a large advantage into your hands if you have the trueth on your side, to cause it to shine with more clearnesse and I hope we shall doe it with moderation as becometh Christians. Yours, William Kiffin.</title>
