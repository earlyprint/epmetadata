         <title>Tythes vindicated from anti-christianisme and oppression. Or A brief discourse concerning ministers maintenance and tythes. Wherein is proved, that, paying and receiving of tythes doe not deny Christ to be come in the flesh, as the Kentish petitioners to the Parliament, Anno 1651. and with them now the Quakers doe clamorously affirm: choosing rather to lye in prison then pay tythes, as being a testimony that Christ is come in the flesh. With a short caveat to the weaker sort of people to beware of these deluded and deluding Quakers. By G. Firmin pastor of the church in Shalford in Essex.</title>
