         <title>A warning for all such as desire to sleep upon the grass: By the example of Mary Dudson maid-servant to Mr. Phillips a gardener ... being a most strange, but true relation how she was found in a dead-sleep in the garden, that no ordinary noise could awake her. As also how an adder entered into her body, the manner of her long sickness, with a brief discovery of the cause at length by her strange and most miraculous vomiting up of about fourteen young adders, and one old adder ... the maid is yet living. The like to this hath not been known in this age. The tune is, In summer time.</title>
