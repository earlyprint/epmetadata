      <title>A true relation of all the skirmishes between our forces and the Cavaliers at Owlny. Sent in a letter from Captaine George Paine, (one of the Captaines of the Red Regiment) who was an eye-witnesse of every severall conflict, to a deare friend of his in London. Wherein each particular is exactly set downe, for the satisfaction of such as are desirous to know the truth; and to stop the mouth of blasphemous malignants. This is licenced and entred into the Hall Booke according to order.</title>
