      <title>A word from the north, sounded into the south, heard, and received of many. Jesus Christ the Son of God, which is the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world; and all that receive this light, and believe in this light, and are obedient to this light, they receive power and do become the sons of God. And as I have heard, so I have and do see in the true light, and am bold to give forth my testimonie that it is true, and there is no other way to salvation but by it. And therefore do I warn all people, and thee, O Kent, with the citie of Canterbury, and town of Maidstone, and all thy magistrates in you all, betimes to consider and take heed that none of you be anie longer enemies to it and its ministers, lest you be found fighters against God.
