      <title>The bios pant&#333;n heideotos, or, [Hebrew] or the vision of eternity held forth, in answer to some antiqu&#230;ries, vvhich were given forth from &#198;gypt by one of Babels builders, a pretended minister of Christ, living in Worcestershire at Beudly, that is called Mr. Henry Osland. But the qu&#230;ries were given forth as the following papers declare, out of simplicity of heart, for satisfaction of the truth: but instead of giving a reasonable account to him that asks, he rails like a greedie hangman, ... So now the antiqu&#230;ries are answered by one who ... is escaped out of &#198;gypt from the magicians ... Whose name is known to God by these three Jews letters in the sequel, [Hebrew] but to men by Iohn Humphryes.</title>
