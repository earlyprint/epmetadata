      <title>A second epistle, being a tender salutation to the seed of Jacob vvherein is contained an exhortation to the called and chosen people of the Lord, who have kept their first love, to abide therein to the end : also, a hand of dear love held forth to the spiritual travellers, who are travelling from Egypt's land of darkness towards the spiritual land of rest : the counsel and determination of the Lord God Almighty founded in the ears of the unfaithful, disobedient and deceitful, who hold the truth in unrighteousness, and cover themselves with a profession of the precious truth, and yet live in the nature and spirit of those who walk in the broad way, that leadeth to destruction : also, a brief rehearsal and discovery of the enemy of man's soul, his workings from the beginning of his appearance unto this day, age, and generation / Charles Marshall.</title>
