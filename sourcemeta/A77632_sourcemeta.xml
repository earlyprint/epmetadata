         <title>The brothers of the separation. Or a true relation of a company of Brownists which kept their conventicle at one Mr. Porters in Goat Alley in Whitecrosse-street, where they were apprehended on Sunday, Aug. 14. 1641. As also, a sermon preached afterwards in the same house by Iohn Rogers a glover, wherein is shewed their wicked rancorous minds at full. This was justified by above twenty men of good life and conversation.</title>
