      <title>A charitable church vvarden. Or, an hypocrite anatomiz'd. Set forth in a discourse betweene two church-wardens, one of them being an honest man, and that's a wonder. VVherein is discovered the manifold abuses and impious actions of many officers in this city, with the oppression of the poores box, frequently used by many church-wardens, especially by him which is here mentioned. Very pleasant and delectable, and very true i'le assure you, as Master Coniwooll the church-warden can witnesse. / VVritten by Thomas tell-troth, and dedicated to all those that are well-willers to vertue, and despisers of vice.</title>
