      <title>A new prognostication for the year of our Lord God, 1674 Being the second after leap-year. Wherein is contained the whole estate of the year in general, together with the eclipses of the sun and moon; as also some predictions of the four seasons of the year: and by what planets the year is governed; with the changes of the moon, and daily disposition of the weather. As also, the whole fairs of Scotland; with a ready table shewing the age of the moon every day throughout this year; serving most fitly for our ancient kingdom, but more properly for the honorable city of Edinburgh. Whose longitude is 21 d. 50 m. latitude 56 d. 4 m. By A. F. philomathet.</title>
