      <title>Two little workes defensiue of our redemption that our Lord went through the veile of his flesh into heaven, to appeare before God for vs. Which iourney a Talmudist, as the Gospell, would terme, a going vp to Paradise: but heathen Greeke, a going downe to Hades, and Latin, descendere ad inferos. Wherein the vnlearned barbarous, anger God and man, saying, that Iesus descended to Hell: and yeelde vnto the blasphemous Iewes by sure consequence vpon their words, that he should not be the Holy one of God.
