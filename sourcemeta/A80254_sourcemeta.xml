      <title>The Companions of good consciences: or an appeal of moderation, justice, and equity, or righteousnesse, peace and love (unfolded in the law of God and nature) to the consciencs [sic] of all, both high and low, rich and poor, of all societies and opinions, amoung all nations. With their mournful lamentation over the unrighteousnesses of men. Wherein men may as in a looking-glasse behold themselves, whether they bear the image of God in their power, places, judgments and callings; or the image of the Divel; for his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of righteousness and obedience &amp;c. to salvation: or of injustice, pride, envie and deceit, &amp;c. to damnation. Herein the God of justice hath said, the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, every one shall be recompenced according to his deeds done in the flesh, whether good or evil. Where then, Lord, shall the unjust, the oppressor, the proud, the covetous, the envious, and all manner of unrighteousness appear? Take it effectually to thy heart.</title>
