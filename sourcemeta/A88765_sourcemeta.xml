         <title>The justice of the Army against evill-doers vindicated: being a brief narration of the court-martials proceedings against Arnold, Tomson, and Lockyer, with the causes and grounds thereof. By which the impartiall reader may plainly judge, how hardly and unchristianly these men deale with the Army, to call that arbitrary, tyrannicall, barbarous murther, in them; which they could not omit without eminent neglect of their duty, and apparant danger of the most desperate events to the Parliament, kingdome, and Army, that can be imagined.</title>
