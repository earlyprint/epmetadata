As also a brief exposition of the thirteenth of the Revelations: much differing from all that ever was before it. Wherein is sett forth; first, who the two beasts therein mentioned are. Secondly, when they began. Thirdly, how long they are to continue. Fourthly, when their end shall be. Wherein that [my]stical number of 666, is fully explained.

A brief exposition of the thirteenth chapter of the Revelation; ..".</note>
