      <title>Evangelium sydereum: or, Revelation demonstrated In three parts. The first being a philosophical discourse leading to the second. The second is Holy Scripture, astronomically handled from the radix of a nativity, and a direction of the luminaries, &amp;c. The third is an appendix touching the scheme of Sol's ingress into Aries for the year 1677. The whole being a divine treatise recommended to the serious perusal of the unprejudic'd mathematician and astrologer, as also of all other persons, to the intent they may behold God's glorious wonders revealed in the heavens. By John Southworth, an experiencer of the love of Jesus, and a well-wisher to the people in scorn called Quakers.</title>
