         <title>Sad and lamentable news from Brick-lane in the hamlet of Spittle Fields, or, A dreadful warning to such as give way to the temptation of the devil, in the deplorable example of Mr. John Child once a famous anabaptist teacher who falling into despair; committed a barbarous and unnatural murther upon his own person, on the 13th day of Octob. 1684.  Together with the circumstances that attended it, likewise his behavior towards such ministers as prayed with him, and administred other spiritual consolations, as also what else materially happened on the sad occasion, being worthy the perusal of all Christians, and published to the end, that it might deter others from falling into the like snare.</title>
