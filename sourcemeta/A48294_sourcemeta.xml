         <title>A short model of a bank shewing how a bank may be erected without much trouble, and without any charge or hazard to any body, and with apparent profit to every body, except theeves, brokers and griping usurers, which bank will be able to give out bills of credit to a vast extent that all persons will accept of rather than mony.
