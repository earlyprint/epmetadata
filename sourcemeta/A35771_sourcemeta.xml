         <title>A Description of the Office of Credit by the use of which none can possibbly sustain loss, but every man may certainly receive great gain and wealth : with a plain demon[s]tration how a man may trade for six times his stock and never be trusted : and that ... there can afterwards no accident happen to cause a deadness or slowness of trade, except warrs, nor need men make any more bad debts : with divers other publick and paivate [sic] conveniences and profits, as also objections hitherto made against it, largely and fully answered.</title>
