      <title>A Seasonable vvord, or, A word in season soberly proposed to the confederation of all such whose hearts are affected with those floods of reproach and blasphemy, which the cause of God in these nations labour under : and may serve, not only as a remembrancer of things past, (stammeringly hinted at) and a call to repentance for mis-improvement thereof : but may prove, a word of encouragement to some whose hands may be weakned in the faith and hope of the work of this day, Psalm 78.7.</title>
