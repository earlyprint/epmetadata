      <title>Great Britains wonder: or, Londons admiration. Being a true representation of a prodigious frost, which began about the beginning of Decemb. 1683. and continued till the fourth day of February following. And held on with such violence, that men and beasts, coaches and carts, went as frequently thereon, as boats were wont to pass before. There was also a street of booths built from the Temple to Southwark, where were sold all sorts of goods imaginable, ... It being the wonder of this present age, and a great consternation to all the spectators.</title>
