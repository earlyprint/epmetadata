      <title>Londons wonder being a most true and positive relation of the taking and killing of a great whale neer to Greenwich; the said whale being fifty eight foot in length, twelve foot high, fourteen foot broad, and two foot between the eyes. At whose death was used harping-irons, spits, swords, guns, bills, axes, and hatchets, and all kind of sharp instruments to kill her: and at last two anchors being struck fast into her body, she could not remoove them, but the blood gusht out of her body, as the water does out of a pump. The report of which whale hath caused many hundred of people both by land and water to go and see her; the said whale being slaine hard by Greenwich upon the third day of Iune this present yere 1658. which is largely exprest in this following discourse.</title>
