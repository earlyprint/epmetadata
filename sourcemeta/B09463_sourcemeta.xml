         <title>Little flocks guarded against grievous wolves. an address unto those parts of New-England which are most exposed unto assaults, from the modern teachers of the misled Quakers.  In a letter, which impartially discovers the manifold haeresies and blasphemies, and the strong delusions of even the most refined Quakerism: and thereupon demonstrates the truth of those principles and assertions, which are most opposite thereunto.  Withjust reflections upon the extream ignorance and wickedness; of George Keith; who is the seducer that now most ravines upon the churches in this wilderness / written by Cotton Mather.</title>
