      <title>A curb for sectaries and bold propheciers by which Richard Farnham the weaver, Iames Hunt the farmer, M. Greene the feltmaker, and all other the like bold propheciers and sect leaders may be bridled and kept within their own beaten way, and the sacred and weightie worke of the ministery bee reserved to men, whom education fits, God cals, and good order in our church prefers thereunto. A matter very considerable in these present times.</title>
