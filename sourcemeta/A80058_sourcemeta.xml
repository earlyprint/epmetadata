      <title>A whip of small cords, to scourge Antichrist (sitting in the temple of God, and exalting himself above, and opposing himself against all that is called God) out of the temple of God; and clearing up the way for the receiving in of the Lord Jesus Christ in his glorious power in and over the church; now exercised in the working of miracles, gifts of healings, and other extraordinary gifts. With the knot at the end of the whip. Whereunto is added, the sheerer sheer'd, and casheer'd; the shaver shav'd, &amp; the grinder ground. By Matthew Coker, being apostolicus propheta, &amp; propheticus apostolus; ut baptista severus, Christi pr&#230;cursor; baptismate spirit&#251;s baptizatus; Antichristi &amp; antispirit&#251;s antithetos oppositus; necnon angelus: non evanus, (qui vanus) sed evangelicus.</title>
