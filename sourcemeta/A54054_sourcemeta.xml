         <title>Some considerations proposed to the City of London, and the Nation of England to calm their spirits and prepare them to wait for what the Lord is bringing about, that they may not run readily into their own ruin and destruction, and by this extraordinary heat of their spirits kindle that fire, which will soon devour them. With a short exhortation to them, relating to their true settlement, and the removal of that which hinders it.</title>
