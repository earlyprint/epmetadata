      <title>A declaration of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament. Shewing the present designe now on foot (by vertue of a pretended commission from His Majesty) for a cessation of armes, or treaty of peace with the rebels in Ireland, now they are brought to such a low condition, that they are inforced to devoure and eate one another in some parts of that kingdome And by what popish instruments and ministers in their councels at the court, the said designe is and hath been carried on; persons of great trust, eminent for their affection to religion, and hatred of the rebels being displaced, and men popishly addicted put in their offices. All serving for the better introduction of popery, and extirpation of the true Protestant religion, in that and other of His Majesties dominions. Die Sabbathi 30. Septemb. 1643. Ordered by the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, that this declaration shall be forthwith printed &amp; published. J. Brown Cler. Parliamentorum.</title>
