      <note>Complains of Parliament's censorhip of the press, nominally aimed at malignants but really punishing puritans, as Lawrence Sandars (God's Love to Mankind), John Lilburn, William Larner, Richard Overton, &amp;c. The Parliament has had much support from unlicensed printing. Especially complains of the punishment of whipping -- Cf. Steele.</note>
