      <title>A most noble speech spoken by the Lord Cambel of Lorne, one of his Majesties most Honourable Privie Counsell of Scotland. Moving the Lords House in Scotland, in his Maiesties presence, for the prevention of such advantages; whereby incendiaries may in the vacancy of Parliaments, any way extort from his Highnesse proclamations, to inforce the bringing in of innovations into the Kirke; or confirming of monopolies, that so all oppressions may be removed from his Majesties subjects of both kingdomes. As also, an honourable reply made by the Lord Lowden, against such, who objected against his former speech.</title>
