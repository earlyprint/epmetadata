      <title>The poets knavery discouered, in all their lying pamphlets wittily and very ingeniously composed, laying open the names of every lying lybel that was printed last yeare, and the authors who made them, being above three hundred lyes : shewing how impudently the poets have not onely presumed to make extream and incredible lyes, but dare also feigne false orders and proceedings from the Parliament with many fictitious speeches : well worth the reading and knowing of everyone that they may learn how to distinguish betwixt the lyes and reall books / written by J.B.</title>
