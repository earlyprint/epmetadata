         <title>The cavaliers letanie. Lately composd by a vvell-willer to his Majesties person, and all his most loyall subjects. Very fitting to be observ'd, and made use of, by all who desire deliverance from the damnable, execrable, unparalell'd, and not before heard of, detestable actions, proceedings, designes, humors, conditions, votes and ordinances. Now fully, and most exactly practised; delivered, and divulged, by the only, (yet illegall) governours, of these our sad, desperate, distracted times.</title>
