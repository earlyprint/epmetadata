         <title>Philastrogus knavery epitomized, with a vindication of Mr. Culpeper, Mr. Lilly, and the rest of the students in that noble art, from all the false aspersions (of the malicious antagonists) cast upon them, about the great eclipse of the Sunne. Whereunto is annexed an epistle to all moderate spirited men, shewing the peoples great mistakes, and misunderstanding of the honest and ingenious artists, who spake truly, as is averred by this ensuing tractate. / Written by J.G. a lover of all ingenious arts and artists - Aprill the 5. 1652.</title>
