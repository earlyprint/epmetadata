      <note>"Wherein is plainly discovered 1. That the Pope is Anti-Christ and that Rome is Babilon. 2. The severall deceitfull workings and enticing means that Babionish whore hath used to intoxicate the kingdomes of the earth ... 3. Probable conjectures that the Anti-Christ party have seene their best dayes ... 4. That the destruction and exterpation of Anti-Christ shall make way for the setting up the kingdome of our Lord Jesus Christ in its glory ..."</note>
