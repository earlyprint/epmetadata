         <title>A Discourse about raising men in which is shewed that it is more for the interest of the nation that the parishes should be oblig'd by law to provide men for the service of the war, than to continue to raise 'em in the ordinary way, and all objections are answered, and particularly that popular one, viz. that this way of raising men is a violation of liberty and property.</title>
