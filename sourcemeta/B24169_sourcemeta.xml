      <title>The High Dutch fortune-teller wherein all those questions relating to the several states, conditions and occasions of humane life, are fully resolv'd and answer'd, according to the rules of art used by the ancient and famous Egyptian magi, or wise men and philosophers. To which is added, a judicial account of phisognomy and palmistry; as it was practised by the ancient Egyptians, (from whom the same was originally derived) shewing a person's good or bad fortune, by the lines and marks that are found in the face and hands, &amp;c. The whole being more correct, than any thing of this nature hitherto published. Licens'd and enter'd according to order.</title>
