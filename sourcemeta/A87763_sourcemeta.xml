      <title>King Charles vindicated: and the people and Armie admonished. Matter of law delivered by the iudges, at the arraignement of the Earle of Essex. 1. For subjects to put themselves into such a strength that the King cannot resist them, and to compell him to governe otherwise than according to his own royall authority, and direction, is manifest rebellion. 2. The deposing and murdering of the King is a consequent in every rebellion : the rebell not suffering the King to live, or reigne, that may punish him for his rebellion.</title>
