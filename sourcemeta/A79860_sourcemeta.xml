         <title>A cloud of vvitnesses: with whom I also appear to bear testimony, that Christ Jesus is the word of God, and not the Bible which is called the Scriptures. For which the word the prophets, apostles, and servants of the Lord, obeying, and bearing their testimony thereunto, have suffered by all generations of men, cruel mockings, stripes, bonds, and imprisonments, by the Egyptians, Philistians, Babylonians, Caldeans, idolaters, back-sliders, Roman Papists, and in generall, the heathen that know not Christ Jesus to be the word of the Lord. ... / Written by him, who is known by the name of Henry Clark.</title>
