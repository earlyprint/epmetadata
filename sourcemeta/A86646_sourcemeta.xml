      <title>Quaking principles dashed in pieces by the standing and unshaken truth. Being an examination of the tenents held forth by certain northern people, viz. 1. Slighting of the written word. 2. A speaking to that within man. 3. Denying the use of reason in the matters of God. 4. A denying of the ascension and being of the body of Christ. 5. A denying of all the ordinances of Christ. 6. A denying honour to men. 7. Affording absolute perfection at one instant. / By Henoch Howet.</title>
