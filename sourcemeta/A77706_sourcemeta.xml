      <title>The Quaker-Jesuite, or, Popery in Quakerisme: being a clear discovery 1. That their doctrines, with their proofs and arguments, are fetcht out of the Council of Trent, Bellarmine, and others. 2. That their practises are fetcht out of the rules and practises of popish monks. With a serious admonition to the Quakers, to consider their ways, and return from whence they are fallen. / By William Brownsword, minister of the gospel at Kendal.</title>
