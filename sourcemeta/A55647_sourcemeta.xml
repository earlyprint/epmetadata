      <title>The Papists St. Dominick and his rosary, or, A full discovery of all the cheats and forgeries imposed by him on the people, which the politick contrivance of his successors have continued to this day in the Church of ROme, ever since the year of Christ 1216, when Pope Honorius the III instituted this disorderly Order of Dominicans a great dignitary whereof (a very few years since) and then an almoner in England, now a cardinal at Rome compiled an abstract of all, as he calls them, sure and safe ways to salvation in their church, one of which is here inserted verbatim, and the very same he gave with his blessing, to a then Romanist, now an eminent discoverer of the hellish Popish Plot : with these words at delivery thereof, This is an excellent paper, and if you will carefully learn and practice it, you may know certainly how to be saved : the truth of which is here humbly offered to the consideration of all men who have the use of reason and reading.</title>
