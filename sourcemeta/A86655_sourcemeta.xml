         <title>A woe against the magistrates, priests, and people of Kendall in the county of Westmerland, pronounced from the Lord by one of his prophets. Which may warn all the persecuting cities and towns in the north, and every where, to repent and fear the Lord, lest the decree go forth against them. Also the stumbling-block removed from weak mindes, who are offended at the strange signs and wonders acted by the servants of the Lord, scornfully called Quakers in the northern parts of this nation.</title>
