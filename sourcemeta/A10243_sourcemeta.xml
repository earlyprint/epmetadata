      <title>Musarum deliciae Contayning more then a select century of royall Latine anagrams, besides diverse written in English, upon the sacred name and titles of our dread soveraigne and of his dearest consort, and their most princely progeny. Together with apposite anagrams upon all the English monarchs that have lived and died since the union of the royall roses and houses of Yorke and Lancaster. Some few of those extracted from his Maiesties imperiall name, have been heretofore presented to his royall hands with gracious acceptance. The Latine anagrammes are expressed in English verses in the opposite columne. Perused anew, and now published altogether, (with the authors assent) by Arthur Pyne Esquire, to whom the anagrams made in honour of the Prince his Highnesse were in speciall manner directed.</title>
