And the direfull actions, and memorable accidents that will befall some great ones in authority, who have inriched themselvs by the sweat of other mens browes. II. The particulars of the greatest catastrophe that ever happened in England, the calling to an account some of the Common-wealths servants, who are now become her masters; and the making of divers headless. III. A diary of the national affairs, the proceedings of the nobles, and a most excellent antidote to cure the malady of the Commons, and to confirm and establish our long-desired liberties. IV. The arraignment and conviction of divers time-buggering changlings, and the admirable effects that will attend the motion of our lawfull governors. V. The rectifying of the magistracy, the administring of true justice to the commonalty, and the exaltation of our long contended for liberty. VI. The violent diseases that will prove obnoxious and incident both to men, and women; and a brief computation of the royal chronicle. Published by authority.</title>
