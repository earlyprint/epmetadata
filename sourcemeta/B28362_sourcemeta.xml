         <title>Robin Hood's golden prize. He met two, priests upon the way, and forced them with him to pray. For gold they pray'd, and gold they had, enough to make bold Robin glad: his share came to four hundred pound that then was told upon the ground: now mark and you shall here the jest, you never heard the like exprest. Tune is, Robin Hood was a tall young man.</title>
