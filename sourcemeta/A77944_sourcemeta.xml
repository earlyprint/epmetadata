      <title>A description of the state and condition of all mankinde upon the face of the whole earth. And a discovery unto all; shewing what man was in his creation before transgression, and what he is in transgression ... Also, the way of restoration, of salvation, redemption, and of life eternal, is here declared ... that all may come to the knowledge of the Creator, and to have fellowship with him again, from whom all the children of men are separated in the state of enmity, and are ignorant of him, and drove from his presence. This is to go abroad into all the earth, through the whole world ... that they ... may be restored again to serve, and worship, and glorifie the living God, who made heaven and earth, and all things therein. By ... Edward Burrough.</title>
