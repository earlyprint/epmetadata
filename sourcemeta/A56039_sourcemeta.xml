         <title>To the flock of God every where gathered out of the worlds wayes, worships, and false separations, into the way of truth, worship of the spirit, and its pure guidance, where true satisfaction and peace is witnessed, that you all may keep there for there is your rest for ever, and your safety in time of your trouble; that none may gad or go astray out of the way of truth for the love of any thing: for such shall meet with tribulation, anguish and wrath from the Lord God Almighty.</title>
