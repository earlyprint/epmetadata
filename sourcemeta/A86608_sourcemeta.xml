      <title>The devils bow unstringed, or, Some of Thomas Dansons lyes made manifest, : which he hath printed and put to publick view in two pamphlets, the one intituled, The Quakers folly made manifest. And the other, The Quakers wisdom not from above. : And in the first page of his narrative he calleth them undoubted truths, but the wise in heart will not so take them, but will consider better of them, for the wise mans eye is in his head. / By Luke Howard.</title>
