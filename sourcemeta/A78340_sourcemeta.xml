         <title>The schismatick sifted through a sive of the largest size: but is now more purely drest. Wherein the chaffe, the froth, and the scumme of Mr. John Vicars his siftings and paintings prove him to be a lame draughts-man, a smearie washer, his colours falsly mixt, and his pencill as course as his colours. Collected out of his own words, and under his own hand. / By T.C. a well-willer to truth and peace. Published according to order.</title>
