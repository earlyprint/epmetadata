      <title>A lamentation for the deceived people of the world. But in particular to them of Alesbury, and those small villages round about her; who are carried away captive by her priests and teachers, laden with sins, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, nor never will, but by the owning the light which comes from the Son of God, the Saviour of all them that believe in the light, and the condemnation of all that hate it.</title>
