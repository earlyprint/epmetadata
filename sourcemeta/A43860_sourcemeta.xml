         <title>The eight sections of Hippocrates Aphorismes review'd and rendred into English, according to the translation of Anutius Foesius ; digested into an exact and methodical form and divided into several convenient distinctions, and every distinction into several chapters, wherein every aphorisme is reduced to its proper subject, whereby the reader may find out any desired aphorisme without the tedious revolution of the whole work ; wherein also many aphorismes are significantly interpreted which were neglected in the former translation.</title>
