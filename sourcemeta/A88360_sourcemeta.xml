      <title>An alarum to vvarre: proclamed by our royall Soveraigne, and his loyall Parliament. To subiugate the savage cruelties, and inhumane massacres acted by the nocent papists; and to vindicate the barbarous blood-shed, and impious insolencies suffered by the innocent protestants of Ireland. To which is annexed an encouragement to all his Maiesties true-hearted, and valiantly disposed subiects, here is England, who are already, or shall be hereafter engaged in this present expedition against those Romish rebells, and all that are confederate with that malignant party, there in Ireland.
