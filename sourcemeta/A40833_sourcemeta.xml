         <title>The famous and delightful history of the golden eagle giving an account of how Albertus, King of Arragon, being at the point of death, was advised to procure the golden eagle, kept by the Queen of Ivyland, for his recovery: how his three sons went in search of that adventure, and what befel them on the way; how Innocentine the youngest, prevailed, and got the golden eagle, with the advice his horse gave him: how his two brothers robbed him of the eagle, and accused him to the King, for which he narrowly escaped death, being utterly disgraced, until the Queen arrived, who restored him to favour, and then married him, &amp;c. with many other adventures, both pleasant and profitable. Licens'd and entered according to order.</title>
