      <title>The Paris relation of the Battel of Landen, July 29th, 1693, between the French, commanded by the D. of Luxemburg, and the confederates, by the K. of Great Britain publish'd by the French King's authority, with his letter, ordering the Archbishop of Paris to sing Te Deum, and a private letter from a very good hand in Paris, with another account of the battel : as also reflexions upon the King's letter, by a very learned French pen and observations by another hand here, proving the French king and his gazeteers account to be inconsistent with themselves, and one another, as well as contrary to truth, and that though the French kept the field, yet they were really loosers by the action.</title>
