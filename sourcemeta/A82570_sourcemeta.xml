      <title>The copies of all letters, papers and other transactions between the Commissioners of the Parliament of England, and the Parliament and Committee of Estates of the kingdom of Scotland, from February 10. 1647. until July 8. 1648. Whereby it may appear, what the endeavors of the kingdom of England have been to keep a good understanding, and to preserve the union between the nations: and how the seizing of Barwick and Carlisle by Papists and other notorious delinquents (against whom both kingdoms lately joyned in war as enemies to the happiness and peace of both) was countenanced (if not procured) by the Scotish nation, contrary to several treaties and agreements between the kingdoms of England &amp; Scotland.</title>
