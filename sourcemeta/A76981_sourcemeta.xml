      <note>In the 1647 edition, the printer's name and address is printed on two lines. The secret 1672 edition has the printer's information printed on one line.</note>
      <note>The 1647 edition exists in two states: 1) "Printed for Mathew Walbanke at Grayes-Inne-Gate"; 2) "Printed for Mathew Walbancke at Grayes-Inne-Gate".</note>
      <note>Wing mistakenly identifies the state with imprint word "Walbanke" as the 1672 secret reprint. Cf. Wing (2nd ed., 1994) B349.</note>
