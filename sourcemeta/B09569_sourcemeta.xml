      <title>The narrative of the most terrible and dreadfull tempest, hurricane, or earthquake in Holland, on Wednesday the 22 of July last, with the particulars of the damages, how it overthrew and bent down vast numbers of steeples, mills, and houses destroyed many men and children, cast away abundance of ships in several places, almost utterly ruined the citty of Utrecht, where the churches following are demolished; the famous Dome, or cathedral of that place. The spire of Saint Jamses. Burr Kirk. St Peters Church, and St. Nicholas Church. And other wonderful devastations; so that 'tis judged by some men, the Dutch have hereby suffered no less damage, than London by the dreadfull fire in sixty-six. / Printed first at Amsterdam, by order of the states, and translated and published in English, for general satisfaction, from the Dutch copy. ; To which is added, a letter from Kent, whereby it appears that the remains of this strange storm proceeding to England ... the same night in Rumney Marsh, and there abated.</title>
