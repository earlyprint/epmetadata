         <title>Prayers of warre for the kingdome, iudgment and iustice which God hath promised to execute under heaven here on earth, for to maintaine his word (or holy name) and to deliver this people. Against the rage and fury of the horrible and pernitious beast, which devoureth and breaketh in peeces, and stampeth the residue with its feete, blasphemeth God the most High, and endevoreth to change times and lawes. Daniel. 7. Whereunto is added an earnest voyce or letter to the late Roman emperour. Written and set forth first in the German tongue by one, who through many dangers a long time undantedly hath in person denounced unto the Roman emperour and many kings, princes and states, the iudgement of God over the world, and the deliverance of Israel, and still doth continue to admonish all people of the same.</title>
