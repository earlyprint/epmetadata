Consisting of two parts. The first, shewing them their duty and concernment in this condition. The second, exhibiting certain forms of meditation, prayer and praise, suited to the beginning, continuance and issue of their visitation. Both composed out of compassion to the poor, who in this contagious sickness want the benefit of a spiritual physician (a wise and able minister to instruct them, and pray with them:) and designed to be a help and means to save their souls: ...
