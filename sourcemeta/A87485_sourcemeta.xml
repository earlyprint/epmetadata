         <note>"To the reader" signed by the editor "C.B." A MS. inscription suggests that C.B. = Christopher Blackwood. Further evidence for this attribution lies in the fact that bound directly after Thomason's copy is a copy of Blackwood's "Apostolicall baptisme" (Wing B3096), the title page of which uses the same border and rules as "Nineteen arguments"; both items were received by Thomason on the same day.</note>
