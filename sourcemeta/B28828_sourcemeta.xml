      <title>The Rector of Dr---r's case concerning the power of suspension from the sacrament stated in a letter from his friend : wherein the three following queries are briefly examined, and modestly resolved, viz. I. Whether a rector hath power to suspend any of the parishioners committed to his charge, from a temporary reception of the sacrament?, and in what cases he may exercise that power?, II. What is the bishops office in such a case?, and whether he may restore such persons so suspended, without a judicial cognizance of the crime objected?, III. Whether in such a case the bishop may regularly command the rector, and whether such commands are obliging?</title>
