Wherein the Parliament, and their General Monck are vindicated, from the aspersions cast upon them by their enemies: in which General Monck is proved to have been alwaies true to his trust, and that he hath no design to set up the King or his interest. Propounded by a lover of his countrey, and a sufferer for the good old cause.</title>
