         <title>A discription of plain-dealing, time, and death, which all men ought to mind whilst they do live on earth. Abuse not plain-dealing, but keep your conscience clear, spend well your time also, then death you need not fear. Plain-dealing is grown out of date because he is poor, many him hate: conscience likewise is laid aside, 'cause he base actions can't abide. To the tune of, A letter for a Christian family. / Written by Thomas Lanfire.</title>
