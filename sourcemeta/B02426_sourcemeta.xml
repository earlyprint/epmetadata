      <title>The country-mans lamentation for the death of his cow. A country swain of little wit one day, did kill his cow because she went astray: what's that to I or you, she was his own, but now the ass for his cow doth moan: most pineously methink he cries in vain, for now his cow,s [sic] free from hunger, and pain: what ails the fool to make so great a stir, she cannot come to him, he may to her. To a pleasant country tune, called, Colly my cow.</title>
