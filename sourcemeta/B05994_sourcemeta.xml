      <title>Strephon and Cloris: or, The coy shepherd and kind shepherdess. He's fearful that his flocks should go astray, and from her kind embraces would away; but she with loving charms doth him so fetter, that for to stay he finds it much the better: when flocks &amp; herds, &amp; all concerns do fail, love must be satisfied, and will prevail. To a pleasant new play-house tune; or, Love will find out the way.</title>
