         <title>Deceit brought to day-light: in an ansvver to Thomas Collier, vvhat he hath declared in a book called, A dialogue between a minister, and a Christian: but by his fruits hee is tryed and found to be neither. In which answer his lies are returned for the founder to prove; his errors laid open, read, and reproved, and he found to be the same in deeds which he accuses the Quakers to be in words. / Published in short for the souls sake, that the simplicity may bee preserved from the subtilty, lest any should believe lies, and so be given up to delusion, and bee damned, by a lover of truth, called, James Naylor.</title>
