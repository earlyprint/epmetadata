Now awakened and presented to themselves in the behalf of their now non-conforming brethren. With a beam of light, discovering a way to peace. Also some qu&#230;res for the better understanding of Mr Edwards last book called Gangr&#230;na. With a parallel betweene the prelacy and presbytery. / By Iohn Saltmarsh preacher of the Gospel.</title>
