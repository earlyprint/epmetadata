      <note>The Emmanuel College copy has the last quartersheet (F&#8308;) in duplicate, folded and bound as a halfsheet; i.e. one set is on leaves 1,4,5,8, the other on leaves 2,3,6,7. This suggests some form of halfsheet imposition--STC.</note>

      <note>Attributed in several 15th-century MS. sources to Thomas Wimbledon. John Foxe, and editions of the sermon from 1582 onwards, also attribute it to an R. Wimbeldon, which has been expanded without apparent justification to Robert or Richard Wimbledon (Halkett &amp; Laing).</note>
