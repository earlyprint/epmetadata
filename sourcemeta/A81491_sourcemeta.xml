      <note>Thomason catalogue attributes the work to Luke Harruney (i.e. Henry Walker), who has signed the "Animadvertors epistle" on A1v, and who claims that Giovanni Diodati is not in fact the author of the letter which appears under his name on leaves A4v-B4. Leaves A2-A3, "Some animadversions upon the letter pretended to be Doct. Deodates, but written by a malignant at Newcastle, .." are apparently by Harruney (i.e. Walker).</note>
