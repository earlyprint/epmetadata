      <title>The discription causes, and discovery, or symptomes of a church papist, or popish Protestant, which may stand in stead this yeare, 1642. Which by reason that this searching Parliament, and wonderfull conjunction of happy planets, hath proved so sickly and crazy unto the Romish constitutions, that it is to be suspected that some of them will flye into churches, for remedy though not for conversion.</title>
