         <title>A most glorious representation of the incomparable free grace of Christ, faithfully, fully, and freely offering himself, at all times, by all manner of means, to all sorts of sinners, under the sound of the gospel. Answering all objections, of all sorts of men, which formerly kept them from coming to Him. Stating the question about universall redemption, in an unusuall way, whereby to escape the rocks on both sides, on which many have split: confuting them that do denie justification by faith; and others assertion of eternall actuall justification, before men do beleeve. Setling many cases of conscience that arise in a perplexed soul about his inward spirituall condition. And lastly prescribing severall divine soliloquies, and soul-wrastlings with Christ, whereby to fall in, and fully close with him by faith. Lisenced by authoritie.</title>
