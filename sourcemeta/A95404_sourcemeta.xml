      <title>The twelve wonders of England, being a strange and wonderful relation of the death of Mr. Parrey, an inn-keeper, living at the sign of the Bell at Temple-bar; and the manner how twelve serpents vvere voided from him a little before his death on Thursday last, some having heads like toads and horses, and others like neuts and dogs, to the great admiration of all that shall read the ensuing subject. Together vvith a narrative of his life and death, his memento and character to all Christians; and other memorable examples of most strange and wonderful prodigies.</title>
