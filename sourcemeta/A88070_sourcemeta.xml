         <title>The Levellers remonstrance, sent in a letter to his excellency the Lord Gen: Cromwel: concerning the government of this commonwealth, his wearing of the crown of honour, and preservation of the lawes, liberties, and priviledges thereof. Together with their propositions and desires, in the name of all the commoners of England; and a strange prophesie, fore-telling the great and wonderfull things that will befall the rulers of this nation, in case they set not the land free to the poor oppressed people.
