      <title>Foure deliberate, and solid queries of state, resolved to the three kingdomes. 1. What is the chiefe and principall cause of the distempers and destructive differences now on foote, and possible or likely to be? 2. What is the most proper and speedy remedy to remove or take away that disease, with the cause thereof the stopping or obstruction in the cause of justice in matters of humanity and which ought to be between man, and man? 3. What is or may be the best meanes to prevent such distempers as are now on foot in this kingdome, or their like which may happen in future time? 4. How may this remedy for the present distemper and meanes of prevention against the same or the like for future be administrated or applyed for the reliefe and preservation of humanity and conscience, when the head by much corruption from within, and without, is seduced and made uncapable of performing its office, the course of government, and execution of justice issuing from thence? With a discovery of a true church and the discipline, and governments thereof.</title>
