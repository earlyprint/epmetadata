      <title>The royall quarrell, or Englands lawes and liberties vindicated, and mantained, against the tyrannicall usurpations of the Lords. By that faithfull patriot of his country Sr. John Maynard, a late member of the House of Commons, but now prerogative prisoner in the Tower of London. Being a legall justification of him, and all those other Lords and aldermen, unjustly imprisoned under pretence of treason, and other misdemeanours; the proceedings against them being illegall, and absolutely destructive to Magna Charta, and the petition of right. Also his protest against the Lords jurisdiction over him, and his appeale unto the Common Law, for tryall, proved both reasonable, and legall. / By Sirrahnio, an utter enemy to tyrannie and injustice.</title>
