         <title>A Modest account of the wicked life of that grand impostor Lodowick Muggleton wherein are related all the remarkable actions he did, and all the strange accidents that have befallen  him, ever since his first coming to London to this 25th of Jan. 1676 : also a particular of those reasons which first drew him to these damnable principles : with several pleasant stories concerning him, proving his commission to be but counterfeit, and himself a cheat, from divers expressions which have fallen from his own mouth.</title>
