      <title>The word of the Lord to all rulers, governors, and magistrates of England, to try themselves by what spirit and power they rule by. That they may come to know, whether they rule by the power of Jesus Christ ... : With a warning to them, that they hearken not unto the priests of England, by whom they have so long bin deceived, even by that lying spirit that is gone out into the mouthes of all the false prophets ... : Also it may be profitable for all men, that they may come to see the difference between the true power that every soule is to be subject unto for conscience sake towards God and that powerthat is not to be obeyed for conscience sake: but rather suffer according to the will of God. : VVith some qu&#230;ries put forth concerning the groundof all true power, and government, which is from that power that every soule is to be subject to for the Lords sake, and not that which is set up in, and by the will of man. / This I have written in the word of the Lord God, as I was commanded by the Lord, on the sixteenth day of the sixth moneth, about the eighth houre of the day ...
