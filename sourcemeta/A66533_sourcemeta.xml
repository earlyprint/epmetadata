      <note>Madan --- "The two pieces next above seem to be one octavo sheet. The former (Wing W289) is a sorrowful complaint that mrs. Gibbs was no better than she should be, and the latter (Wing 288) a palinode confessing that the writer was mistaken in accusing the actress, who is now restored to favour.".</note>
