         <title>Popish cruelties wherein may be seen that Romish traitors have now the same murthering and treasonable principles and practices they had in Q. Elizabeth's reign, against the established governour and government of these kingdoms. And yet after conviction, evident proof, free and frequent confession of being guilty; before, at, and after their trial, yet at their execution, to deceive the world and their own consciences, they seem as innocent as the child unborn. All which plainly appears in this exact account of the trial, confession, conviction, condemnation, &amp;c. of Dr. W. P. To which are added forms of prayers and thanksgivings to be used for all kings, &amp;c. and in the Parliament-House, when there is any danger of Popery.</title>
