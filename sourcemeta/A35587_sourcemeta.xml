      <title>The Case and cure of persons excommunicated according to the present law of England in two parts : I. the nature of excommunication, as founded in Holy Writ : the persons intrusted with that power, the objects of that censure and the method prescribed by God for it : the corruptions of it in times of popery, with the acts of the popish clergy, to fortify it with under these corruptions : the several writs of common law, and the statute laws made in those times, and still in force : to restrain the abuse of this censure, and to deliver the subjects from the oppression of it : II. the mischievous consequents of excommunication as the law now stands at present in England : with some friendly advice to persons pursued in inferior ecclesiatical courts by malicious promoters : both in order to their avoiding excommunication, or delivering themselves from prisons, if imprisoned because they have stood excommunicated fourty days.</title>
