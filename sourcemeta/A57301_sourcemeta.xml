      <title>A general epistle of universal love and good will to all the families of the earth, who are seeking the Lord, and enquiring after the knowledge of him, whom to know is eternal life, whether they be in forms of worship, or without, or suppose they have got above all forms, &amp;c. With directions, how, and by what means, the saving knowledge of God is again restored, and where he may be found; and how, from the least to the greatest, all may attain to the knowledge of Him, according to his promise, by the apostle.</title>
