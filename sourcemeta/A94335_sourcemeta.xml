The second by Mistris Warden, being her observations on her husbands reverent speech, to certain gentlewomen of Ratliffe and Wapping. The third by Mistris Wardens chamber-maid as she was dressing her mistris, the wifedome and learning whereof will amaze your judgements. / Published by Antibrownistus Puritanomastix.</title>
