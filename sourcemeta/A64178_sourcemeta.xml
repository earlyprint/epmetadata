         <title>Love one another: a tub lecture, preached at Watford in Hartfordshire at a conventicle on the 25. of December last, being Christmas day, by John Alexander, a joyner. His text was taken out of the epistle of Saint Iohn, and himselfe was taken by Captaine Bird, Lieutenant Rock, and other officers, from whom he received such usage as his doctrine did deserve; for which the said officers were commended by the Parliament.</title>
