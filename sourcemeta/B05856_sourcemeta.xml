      <title>The shoomakers delight. Or. A new dialogue betwixt a west country shooemaker &amp; his love. Who after five years travel for her sake he back return'd and she amends did make, for after he to her had told his mind she seemed not at all to him unkind, young men &amp; maids then read these lines and see how they in love did lovingly agree. To the tune of, When soll will cast no light.</title>
