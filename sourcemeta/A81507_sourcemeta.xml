         <title>The discourse and sad complaints betwixt the French-man and the Irish-man; evidently declaring, that the King was the only cause of the progresse and continuation of the warres in Ireland, to be brought over into England; and that the Queen was the only occasion of the recruits and monies which have been levied, to be transported over from France. With a true narration of the sad successe that hath followed His Majesties armies and doth still keep them company; not onely in the west, but in divers other places, and the great possibility wherein the Parliaments forces are of putting a speedy period to these long and unnaturall wars. VVith a full account of the severall remarkable victories which it hath pleased God of late in divers places to confer on the army of the Parliament.</title>
