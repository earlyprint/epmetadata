      <title>An epistle to all Friends that be travelling towards the holy city and rest that is in the everlasting life, that they may not over-charge themselves, nor burden themselves in their journey. With a visitation of pure love to all such as have err'd in their hearts from the holy commandment, that to the Lord, who is very gracious and merciful, with all their hearts they may be turned, and so be by him saved.</title>
