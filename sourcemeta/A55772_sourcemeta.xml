         <note>"The design of this odd volume was clearly to provide a new and improved edition of the History of Wales by Caradoc, as translated by Humphrey Lloyd, edited by David Powell, and printed in London in 1584. What the volume actually contains is a short topography of Wales, altered and abbreviated from the similar description (by Prise and Lloyd) printed in 1584, and the early part of the British Annals of Caradoc, Caradoc's part being in black-letter, Powell's additions in italic, and Robert Vaughan's additions in roman. The printing ends abruptly, ... with catchword 'made'."--Madan.</note>
         <note>Several copies note in MS. that this edition was prepared by Thomas Ellis, Jesus College, Oxford. "Ellis stopped at p.128 on finding that Percy Enderbie in his Cambria triumphans (Lond. 1661) had covered the same grounds and used the same materials"--Madan.</note>
