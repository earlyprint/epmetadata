      <title>Erastus Senior scholastically demonstrating this conclusion that (admitting their Lambeth records for true) those called bishops here in England are no bishops, either in order or jurisdiction, or so much as legal : wherein is answered to all that hath been said in vindication of them by Mr. Mason in his Vindici&#230; ecclesi&#230; Anglican&#230;, Doctor Heylin in his Ecclesi&#230; restaurata, or Doctor Bramhall ... in his last book intituled, The consecration and succession of Protestant bishops justified : with an appendix containing extracts out of ancient rituals, Greek and Latine, for the form of ordaining bishops, and copies of the acts of Parliament quoted in the third part.</title>
