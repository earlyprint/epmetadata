      <title>A description and explanation of 268. places in Jerusalem and in the suburbs thereof, as it flourished in the time of Jesus Christ Answerable to each of the 268. figures that are in its large, and most exact description in the map; shewing the several places of the acts and sufferings of Jesus Christ, and his holy Apostles. As also of the Kings, prophets, &amp;c. Very useful for the more clear and fuller opening of very many places in the prophets (as also in Josephus, and other histories) especially in the Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles. Translated by T.T. Reviewed, and in many places rectified according to the Holy Scriptures, and some things further cleared: with additions of many scripture proofs: by H. Jessey.
