      <title>Sir Iohn Presbyter not dead. As the malicious author of that abusive pamphlet, that nine-dayes-wonder lately printed, intituled, The last will and testament of Sir John Presbyter, divulged. But was onely bereft of his soule for a few dayes, and is now againe revived. The wondrous things he saw, during his confinement to the lower parts. What committee-men, commanders, and ministers, hee saw there grievously tormented. Faithfully taken from his owne mouth. Reade and wonder.</title>
