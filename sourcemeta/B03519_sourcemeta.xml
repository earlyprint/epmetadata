Giving an account of an old miserable woman, who lately kept a blind ale-house, in St. Tooley-street, near the burrough of Southwark; who was so wretchedly covetous, as to deny her self the common benefits of life, as to meat and cloaths; leaving, at her death, about eighteen hundred pounds, to her cat; rising to say often, when the cat mew'd, peace Puss, peace; thou shalt have all, when I am dead. To the tune of, The bleeding heart, &amp;c.</title>
