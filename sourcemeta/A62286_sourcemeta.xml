         <title>A short relation of some words and expressions that were spoken by Barbara scaife in time of her sickness, a little before she departed this life she was betwixt fifteen and sixteen years of age, daughter to William and Issabel Scaife of the Blacksike near Appleby, in the county of Westmerland: in profession of the principles of light and life in Christ Jesus. Which those people commonly called Quakers do bear testimony to, and had fellowship with, from their child-hood, and had a care upon them to bring up their children in the fear of the Lord, and in the knowledge of that truth which they had believed in: and which their children were in their tender age truly acquainted with.</title>
