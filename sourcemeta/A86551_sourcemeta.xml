      <title>A message sent from the kingdom of Ireland to a member of the Army, under the command of His Excellency the Lord Generall Fairfax, concerning their proceedings in this nation, and the crowning of their heads with laurel. With severall qu&#230;ries, touching the bleeding condition of both nations, viz. I. Whether there be any way to unite the representative body of a state, and cut the heart in the middle. II. Can a kingdom think you stand fast, and the affections of men in it tatter to and fro. III. Shall the Presbyterian strive to get a vote one day, and the Independent another the next, that so the day following you may be the fitter to clash one another a pieces; and doe you think this way to better and settle a kingdom? Imprimatur, Theo: Jennings.</title>
