      <title>Strange and true news from Westmoreland. Being a true relation of one Gabriel Harding, who coming home drunk, struck his wife a blow on the breast, and killed her outright, and then denyed the same: likewise how a stranger did come to the house cloathed in green, the people that were eye witnesses said it was an angel; and how the stranger or angel did give sentence on the man for killing of his wife: also how Satan did break the mans neck that did forswear himself, and the stranger or angel did command Satan to hurt none else, and to vanish; then did the stranger cloathed in green take his leave of the people; whereof he [sic] chiefest in the parish desired it might be put into print, and have hereunto set their hands. Tune is, In summer time.</title>
