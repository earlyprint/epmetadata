      <title>A true declaration of the suffering of the innocent, who is hated and persecuted without a cause. Wherein is discovered the zeale of the magistrates and people of Banbury, persecuting and imprisoning them that are sent of the Lord in love to their souls to warn them of the evill of their wayes. Declared in a letter sent to William Allen, called justice of peace, with an answer to the false accusations charged upon the innocent. Also their proceedings laid open, and proved to be contrary to the Scriptures. / By Anne Audland, whom the world scornfully calls Quaker.</title>
