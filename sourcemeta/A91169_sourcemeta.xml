         <title>A declaration and protestation of the peers, lords, and barons of this realme, against the late treasonable proceedings, and tyrannicall usurpations of some members of the Commons House, who endeavour to subvert the fundamentall laws and regall government of this kingdom, and enslave the people to their boundlesse tyranny instead of freedom. February 8. 1648.</title>

         <note>Anonymous. By William Prynne. Cf. Wing. Pretends to be from the House of Lords, and apparently accepted as such by Steele; but the Lords was voted 'ought to be abolished' by the Commons on 6 February and last met that day -- Cf. Foster, p. 207.</note>
         <note>Imprint from Wing.</note>
         <note>Being engaged by conscience and the Covenant they protest that the authority of the realm is in the King and Peers, not in the Commons, who cannot judge but only impeach before the Lords. They protest against the trial of the King, the disinheriting of the Prince, the new Court of Justice, the acting without Royal Commission, the vote abolishing the Peers (6 Feb.), and repudiate all acts, ordinances, &amp;c. of this Parliament -- Cf. Steele.</note>
