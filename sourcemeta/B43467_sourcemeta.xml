      <title>Truth vindicating itself from treason and rebellion, or, A brief discovery how the faith of the Grace of God to manward, in, and through Christ Jesus our Lord, who once appeared in the end of the world, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, and by means thereof is Saviour of the world as likewise the hope of his appearing the second time without sin, to the salvation of them that look for him : not onely clears itself from, but most directly and severely reproves all manner of sedition, and resisting the powers that God by his providence sets over us, whether they be good and gentle to us, or whether they be froward, and rise up against us / by Th. Moore Junior.</title>
