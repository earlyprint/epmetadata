      <title>Coleman-street conclave visited, and, that grand imposter, the schismaticks cheater in chief (who hath long, slily lurked therein) truly and duly discovered containing a most palpable and plain display of Mr. John Goodwin's self-conviction (under his own hand-writing) and of the notorious heresies, errours, malice, pride, and hypocrisie of his most huge garagantua, in falsly pretended piety, to the lamentable misleading of his too-too credulous soul-murthered proselytes of Coleman-street &amp; elsewhere : collected, principally, out of his own big-bragadochio and wavelike-swelling and swaggering writings, full-fraught with six-footed terms, and flashie rhetoricall phrases, far more than solid and sacred truths, and may fitly serve (if it be the Lords will) like Belshazzars hand-writing, on the wall of his conscience, to strike terrour and shame into his own soul, and shamelesse face, and to un-deceive his most miserably cheated and inchanted, or bewitched followers / by John Vicars.</title>
