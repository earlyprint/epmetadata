      <title>This is a controversy betwixt the Quakers and the Papists. Being answers to several papers, and replies to the answers of the Romish spiritual Aegyptian Sea, whose tongue hath of late spoke, and Sea hath the late swelled; but the bounds, which is the power of God, which the apostles was in, keeps it from over-flowing. And also here is some queries for them to answer, and also a challenge for them to come forth to try their Christ and God, which they make of bread and wine, to the people called Quakers, and not to be ashamed of him, for we are not ashamed of Christ before men. For they that love the light will bring their deeds to the light, that it may be manifest whether they be wrought in God yea or no, Joh. 3. Whereunto is added an answer to a paper of Henry Forts, one who is turned against the truth. / This 11 day of the 11 month, 1664. By G.F.</title>
