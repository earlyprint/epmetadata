      <title>A looking-glass for the Jews wherein they may clearly see that the Messiah is come, by the prophets in the Old Testament (above sixteen hundred years since) and the manifest testimonies since. And also, they may see their own blindness and ignorance of their own prophets, and of the Messiah unto this day. By which my desire is, they may turn to him, that their eyes may be opened, that they may see him whom they have pierced. By G. F. To which is added, a paper writ formerly to the Jews who assemble in Bevers-Marks, London, to be read and considered by them; with a few queries for them to answer. By G.W.</title>
