         <title>The merchant of Scotland, and the unfortunate damosel. A damosel fair in Scotland born, being full of grief and left forlorn, 'twas an English-man that she did love, who left her and unkind did prove: in private she did make great moan. Because her English-man was gone. An Edenborough-merchant there, her sighs and groans did chance to hear: and married her, but in short time, was forc'd to leave his native chine; and sail unto some forraign shore, leaving her sadder then before. To a pleasant countrey tune.</title>
