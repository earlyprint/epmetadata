         <title>A discouerie of sundrie errours and faults daily committed by lande-meaters, ignorant of arithmetike and geometrie, to the damage, and preiudice of many her Maiesties subiects with manifest proofe that none ought to be admitted to that function, but the learned practisioners of those sciences: written dialoguewise, according to a certaine communication had of that matter. By Edward Worsop, Londoner. Euery one that measureth land by laying head to head, or can take a plat by some geometricall instrument, is not to be accounted therfore a sufficient landmeater, except he can also prooue his instruments, and measurings, by true geometricall demonstrations.</title>
