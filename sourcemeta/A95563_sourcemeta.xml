         <title>No Mercurius Aulicus; but some merry flashes of intelligence, with the pretended Parliaments forces besiedging of Oxford foure miles off, and the terrible taking in of a mill, instead of the King and citie. Also the breaking of Booker, the asse-tronomicall London figure-flinger, his perfidious prediction failing, and his great conjunction of Saturne and Iupiter dislocated. / By John Taylor.</title>
