         <title>The London lads lamentation to Cupid. Or; VVhen shall I my true-love have? All young men must to Cupids power submit, courage and wisdom, vertue too, &amp; wit: none can his mighty power &amp; charm withstand he, like young beauty, always will command: and here young maidens easily may find, how apt young-men are to be true &amp; kind such constancy in them could scarce be found should men go search the universe all round. To an excellent new tune, sung at the court. This may be printed, R.P.</title>
