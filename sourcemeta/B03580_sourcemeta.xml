      <title>The ghost of K. Charls and Serieant [sic] Bradshaw. Being a discourse betwixt Charles late king of England, the arch-bishop of Canterburie and Serjeant John Bradshaw. Wherein the unjust proceedings at the triall of the late king in the High-court of justice are justly discovered: the full manner of it debated and the whole course of affaires from the beginning of the wars to these present times, fully and most lively represented. Together, with the means to preserve both church and state from the great and gaping ruines which do threaten to devour them.</title>
