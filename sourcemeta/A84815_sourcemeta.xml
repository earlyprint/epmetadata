         <title>The teachers of the vvorld unvailed. VVherein the ground of their ministry is manifested, both in doctrine and practice, to be out of the light which cometh from Christ, in the witchcraft deceiving the people. Where as in a glasse they are seene to be such that the prophets woo was against, and which Christ gave warning of, and the apostles saw in their dayes enter the world, and are now in this day manifest to the children of light, / and declared against by G.F. that all people may from them turne. With a briefe declaration of the seed of evill doers, which from time to time have withstood the truth of God in all ages. As also certaine queries given forth touching Q. Maries law made for defence of the priests and Jesuits, by which the priests and false teachers of this nation now guard themselves, and persecute the children of light even to death by long and tedious imprisonments in holes and dungeons.</title>
