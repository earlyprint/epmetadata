      <title>A door opened to the imprisoned seed in the vvorld, and the way of freedom by the spirit of truth, sent out into the world in love to the sheep that have long been lost, which may serve any who simply seek the life of what they possess, and may shew the feigned &amp; false in heart, the cause why they are shut out of truths power : wherein the elect way is opened to the blind, with encouragements to enter and walk therein : also the fruits of the free-born cleared from legal performances, and the children of bondage shewed the nature of their own works : Christ Jesus known to be king in his temples, through the power of the Holy Ghost, and sword of the spirit lifted up against the man of sin in true judgment / by J.N.</title>
