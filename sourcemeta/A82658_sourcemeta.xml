         <title>A declaration of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, concerning the present lamentable, and miserable condition of Ireland, the poore Protestants in some places being forced to kill their horses to satisfie their hunger, and very many others having perished by famine. With some sad and serious motives propounded by both houses, to all pious and well affected Englishmen for their speedy reliefe, a thing earnestly to be intended considering what courses are now set on foot at Oxford, for bringing those barbarous rebels into this kingdom. Whereunto are added, the severall propositions made by the committees of the House of Commons, and the committee of adventurers chosen in London out of the body of the adventurers, and ratified by the House, for the more perfect incouragement of all that wish well to the generall cause of religion, the relieving of the Protestant brethren in Ireland, and the safety of this state and kingdome.</title>
