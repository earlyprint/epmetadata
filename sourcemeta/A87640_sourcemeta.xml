      <title>The new Returna brevium or the law returned from Westminster and restored in brief to its native, antient, and proper habitation, language, power, puritie, integritie, cheapness, briefness, plainness. Rescued out of the sacrilegious hands, barbarous disguises, &#230;nigmatical intricacies, lucrative constructions, extorted verdicts, fals judgments, &amp; bribeful executions of her perjured impostors, fals interpreters, iailers, catchpols, attorneys, &amp;c whereunto is added the Petition of Right, granted by Parliament in the 3 year of King Charls, and confirmed by this (although to bee found in larger volumes) for cheapness to the generalitie to inform themselvs what is their rights. Written by John Jones of the Neyath in com. Brecon Gent.</title>
