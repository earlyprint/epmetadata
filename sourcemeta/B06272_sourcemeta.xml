      <title>A true relation of a monstrons [sic] female-child, with two heads, four eyes, four ears, two noses, two mouths and four arms, four legs, and all things else proportionably, fixed to one body. Born about the 19th of May last, ar [sic] a village called Ill-Brewers near Taunton Dean in somerset=shire. Likewise a true and perfect account of its form so prodigiously strange, with several remarkable passages observed from it since its birth, so great and amazing, that the like has not been known in many ages: with many other circumstances. As it was faithfully communicated in a letter, by a person of worth, living in Tauntou-Dean [sic], to a gentleman here in London, and attested by many hundreds of no mean rank; and well koown [sic] to several gentlemen in and about London.</title>
