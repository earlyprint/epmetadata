         <title>A caveat for young men. Or, The bad husband turn'd thrifty. This caveat may serve both for old and yong [sic], for to remember that old age will come; if you these verses do minde and read, I hope hereafter you will take better heed: this song it was set forth and penn'd, to teach bad husbands to amend. Therefore bad husbands mend your lives. And be more kinder to your wives. To the tune of, Hey ho my honey.</title>
