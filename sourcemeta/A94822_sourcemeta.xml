         <title>True intelligence from Cornwall: being a true relation of the rising of 600. fishermen and their wives, and falling upon Sir Ralph Hopton and the Cavaliers, wounding Sir Ralph himselfe, by striking him from off his horse, killing diverse of his men, and putting the rest to flight: and how the said fishermen pillaged the town of Bodnam in Cornwall, which caused the whole county to be up in armes, and the beacons to be fired throughout the whole county. Also how the day following Sir Ralph Hopton with 500. men took some few fishermen, and tied them to trees, whipping them naked with broome and furse, and how he pillaged M. Tresuses house. Likewise the taking of two barks which came from the Governour of Flanders with armes for 3000. men; and the names of the malignants in the foresaid county. Sent in a letter from Sir Jonathan Trelawney to M. Trelawney merchant in London.</title>
