      <title>A seasonable treatise for this age occasioned by a letter written by one Mr. Woolsey prisoner in Norwich, to the then-exiled Church at Amsterdam; in which he endeavours to prove it unlawful to eat blood, things strangled, and things offered to idols, now in the times of the Gospel. Which letter is by the consent of the said Church answered; the grounds and reasons therein, examined and refuted; and the contrary thereunto proved from scripture: by Francis Johnson pastor Henry Ainsworth teacher Daniel Studley Stanshal Mercer elders of the same church. Written long since, but never published till now.</title>
