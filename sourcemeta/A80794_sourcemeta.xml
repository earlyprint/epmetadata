         <title>A learned and exceeding well-compiled vindication of liberty of religion: written by Junius Brutus in Latine, and translated into English by N.Y. who desires, as much as in him is, to do good unto all men: wherein these three following propositions are undenyably proved, and all objections to the contrary fully answered. 1. That if magistrates, in case of necessity, promise hereticks liberty of religion; they are bound to performe their promise after that necessity ceaseth. 2 That magistrates may with a safe conscience grant hereticks liberty of religion, and oblige themselves by an oath, or bond of assurance, to provide for their safety and security. 3. That magistrates ought to grant hereticks liberty of religion, and to oblige themselves by an oath, or bond of assurance, to provide for their safety and security.</title>
