         <title>Two horrid murthers; one, committed upon the person of Henry the Fourth of France. The other upon his son in law, Charles the First of England. Of the various and lasting tortures endured by the murtherers of the one, (extracted out of Mr. Howell his history of Lewis the 13th) and of the early short punishments undergone by the murtherers of the other.  Though for the atrocity of the fact, they were not inferior to the first, but considering all circumstances, and complication of treasons went beyond him / by James Parry of Poston, Esquire.</title>
