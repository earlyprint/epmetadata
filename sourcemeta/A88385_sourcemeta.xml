         <title>A brief exposition upon the second Psalme. Wherein wee have that time modestly pointed at, (by the favourable direction of that significant then in the 5th v.) in which the father will in wrath to the (professing, refined) rulers of the world set his Sonne on Sion. And a description of the work the Son then performeth, both by his spirit, and his mysticall body. With usefull observations thereupon. Tending to clear up the scope of the whole Psalme. With application to our times. / By William Llanvædonon of P.H.C.</title>
