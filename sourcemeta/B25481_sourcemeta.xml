      <title>The godly mans gain; and the wicked mans woe; or, Good news from Heaven for the righteous Plainly shewing the wonderful manifestation of the love of God to their souls, their blessed and happy condition, both in this life and that which is to come. Likewise, the dreadful condition of the wicked, their danger by reason of sin, because of the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against the workers of iniquity. Lastly, some seasonalble warnings, and perswasions, for poor sinners to prepare for judgement, that they may be able to stand in the evil day, and avoid those visible tokens of Gods fury, and their eternal ruine in flames of fire, prepared for the wicked, who delight to make void the law of God.
