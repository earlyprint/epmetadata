Demonstrating, T.P. (alias D.) his grosse mistakes of Mr. Crofton his principle and argument: as also the fallacie and vanity of his pleaded necessity for his (confessed) separation from publique assemblies, which is found insufficient to acquit him of schisme.  To which is added a position, disputing the lawfulnesse of ministers receiving an imposed liturgy.</title>
