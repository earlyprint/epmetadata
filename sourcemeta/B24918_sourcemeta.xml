      <title>A serious and earnest exhortation and seasonable warning given forth in two epistles to the people and inhabitants of Aberdeen, being the breathings of one of the despised sufferers for the blessed truth (in scorn called a Quaker) within their city, while I was under deep exercise of spirit, &amp; travail on their behalf for several dayes; so that I was made to become as a sign unto them, to warn them to flee from the wrath to come by speedy repentance, / who am known by the name of Andrew Jaffray.</title>
