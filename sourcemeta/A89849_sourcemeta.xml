      <title>A salutation to the seed of God. And a call out of Babylon, and Egypt, from amongst the magitians, where the house of bondage is, and the imaginations rules above the seed of God, the cause of all blindnes, and condemnation. Also that which is perfect made manifest, even everlasting righteousnesse, which endures for all generations, ... With the way to him, set forth most for such as groan for freedome from the power of sin; but may be serviceable to all who loves his appearance. Also a testimony from Christ what he is in this world, and where he is; ... Also a suite to such rulers, magistrates, and governours, as have not wholly hardened their hearts, and stopt the eare against the voyce of the spirit, that they may hear and their soules may live, and be established a blessing to the nations. With some things more added to this second impression. / Written in love to all your soules, by him who is called James Naylor.</title>
