      <title>A pleasant discourse betweene conscience and plain-dealing Discovering their trauels, and hard fortunes since these times began; and what hard shifts they have bin put too, for want of entertainment. With their resolution once more to try their fortunes; and to discover in their travels, all that are enemies to conscience and plain-dealing: and to give notice to all honest men, in all cities, and towns, to beware of their hipocriticall double dealing, in their tradings. Then listen all people now, for we are fully bent to tel knavs their own, &amp; give honest men content. Written by C.H. a well-wisher to conscience &amp; plain-dealing; and to ask those that will entertaine them. But for him that wishes ill to them, or mee pray pass a long, A.K.I.C.U.B.</title>
