      <title>A treatise of the souls union with Christ wherein is declared what this union with Jesus Christ is, and many false grounds of union discovered, in which these two weighty guest are largely handled, viz. : how souls do attain the first, certain, infallible evidence of union with Christ : how souls that conceive themselves to have received certain and satisfying evidence of their union with the Lord Jesus may know certainly and infallibly that their evidence of union with Christ received is really from God, and not a diobolical enthusiasm or inspiration, or a delusion from the Devils translastion of himself into angelical glory / J.L.</title>
