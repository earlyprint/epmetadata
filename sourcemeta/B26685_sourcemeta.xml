      <title>The burthen of Jssachar, or, The tyrannical power and practices of the Presbyteriall government in Scotland in their [brace] I. Parochiall session, II. Presbyterie, III. Provinciall synods, IV. Generall assembly : with the articles of Presbyterian faith inconsistent with monarchie : whereby it is evident, that the Presbyteriall fingers are heavier than Episcopall loynes, these correcting with a rod, those with a scorpion : and therefore it is not the kingdome and government of Jesus Christ, whose yoake is easie, his burthen light, and his scepter a scepter of righteousnesse.</title>
