      <title>The honesty and true zeal of the Kings witnesses justified and vindicated against those unchristian-like equivocal protestations of Dr. Oliver Plunkett, asserting in his last speech his own innocency being as great damnation to his soul, as any of his former trayterous and hellish practices against his King and countrey, as breathing them upon the point of death, without any time of repenting the enormity of them with true contrition / by Florence Weyer, Gent.</title>
