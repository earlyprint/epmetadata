      <title>The Engagement vindicated; from all the objections, cavils, scruples, that wilfull opposers, or doubtfull, unresolved judgements may cast upon it. Wherein, all such objections are answered; the government proved; the Engagement it self both lawful, and necessary, from clearest principles of conscience and reason. To the satisfaction of all such as are doubting. / By T.B.</title>
