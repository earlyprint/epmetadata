         <title>Short-hand yet shorter: or, The art of short-writing advanced in a more swift, easie, regular, and natural method than hitherto Whereby the former difficulties in placing the vowels are removed; they, the dipthongs and consonants, further contracted; the particles, pronouns, degrees of comparison, persons, moods, tenses, contrarieties, repetitions, sentences negative and interrogatory, are shortned. The rules are plain, easie to be remembred and applied to any other short-hand, that such as have learned other authors may have hence a very considerable help to write more swiftly without altering their foundation.
