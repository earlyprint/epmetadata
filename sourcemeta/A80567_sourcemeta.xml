         <title>A cordial elegie &amp; epitaph upon the much lamented death of that incomparable Prince Henry Duke of Glocester, brother to our Sovereign Lord the King, the most perfect and accomplished prince of his years the Christian world could boast of; and a royal cedar endowed with as many great vertues as mortality could receive; a prince of such fortitude abroad and wisdom at home, vastness of wit and understanding, that no prince could parrallel, always steadfast in religion, and a prince who, if we compare his valour with his meekness, his knowledge with his innocence, and his religion with his youth, no prince can equalize; deceased the 13th of September 1660.</title>
