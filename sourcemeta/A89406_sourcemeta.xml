         <title>An Exact book of entries, of the most select judiciall vvrits used in the common-law. Translated from the originall manuscript, which was collected by the hands of that eminent clerk, Robert Moyle Esq; late one of the prothonotaries of the Court of Common-Bench. A work of much industry, as may appeare by the authors great paines in quoting of book-cases, opinions of judges, number rolls, and many other requisites, for the confirmation of every entry, whereof none have been ever published before. Printed now for the use and benefit of all, but aimed most especially for such as are most conversant in the common-law. By J.H. Gent. With a perfect table in which may be found the principall matters therein contained.</title>
