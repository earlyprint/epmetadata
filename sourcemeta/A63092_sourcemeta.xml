         <title>Treason in graine that most traiterous, or libel of Fitz-harris, whereby he design'd to raise a rebellion amongst us the better to make way for a French invasion, and our utter destruction, as it was read in both Houses of Parliament at Oxford, and upon which the House of Commons impeached him of high treason. Falsly and malitiously called by him, the true English-man speaking plain English, in a letter from a friend to a friend.</title>
