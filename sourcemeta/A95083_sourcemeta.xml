      <title>A true narrative of a strange prodigious toad for size and shape full fourteen inches long, and ten over : the toad on the hinder-parts : with a tayl three times as long as his body, with a forked sting at the end. : Seen lately at a hunting about the Devils-Arse-oth'-Peak in Darbyshire. : The sculpture of which, in copper, will shortly be published, and examin'd as to both more narrowly by some who are now in the city and whose usual curiosity in things so rare, led them to this exactness of observation. / With allowance, R. L'Estrange.</title>
