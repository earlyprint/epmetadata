With the cravens desire, that the quarrell may be ended, either upon Tower-Hill, or at the narrow place turning up to Padington. Also the sad complaint the craven made to some of his friends at his death, that he could not be buryed, and intomb'd as Presbytery John was, he therefore only desires one of the beadles of Bride-Well to be his excequetor.
