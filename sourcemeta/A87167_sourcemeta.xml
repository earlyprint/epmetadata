         <title>An answer to lame Giles Calfines Messe of pottage, which hee termes in his halting speech to be well crummed and seasoned, &amp;c. Proving that the service-booke is no better than pottage, in comparison of divers weeds which are chopt into it, to poyson the taste of the children of grace, by the advice of the whore of Babylons instruments and cooks. In which small tract you shall find such reasons given against it, as are unanswerable by any man whatsoever. For pure prayer is Gods temple, and where it is not so used, it is but idolatrie and will-worship. by M. T. S. T. R. A. I. S. P. H.</title>
