         <title>A true relation of a late victorie obtained by Sir Ralph Hopton against my Lord of Stamfords forces in Cornwall.

Being the copy of a letter written from Saltash by a Very impartiall hand, dated the 24. of this present Ian. 1642. which many other letters that came by the same post (no doubt) will confirm.</title>
