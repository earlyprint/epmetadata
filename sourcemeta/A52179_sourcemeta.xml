      <title>A loving invitation, and a faithful vvarning to all people, who believe they must give an account to the righteous God for the deeds done by them in the flesh that they speedily seek to make their peace with the living God, who made them, before the stroak of his justice come upon them, which is the breathing of my life, even to all who resort unto, or be separated from the House of Rimmon, but are not yet truly come to own the seed of life, the light of Christ in their consciences, to be their teacher, and so to believe in it, as they may be saved by it / by Martin Mason.</title>
