         <title>The little Bible of the man or the Book of God opened in man by the power of the Lamb. Wherein God is the spirit or inside of the book, and man the letter or out-side of it. In whom, as in a glass, you may both behold the spirit and letter of the holy Scriptures in the new man; fulfilled and explained from Genesis to Jeremiah. This is the first volume of Gods Book in man. Written by a weak instrument of the Lords, Capt. T. Butler.</title>
