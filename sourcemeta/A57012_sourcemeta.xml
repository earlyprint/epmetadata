      <title>Antipas, or, The dying testimony of Mr. James Renwick, Minister of the Gospel, who suffered at the grass-market of Edinburgh, Feb. 17, 1688 : his sentence was founded on these following heads : 1. Because he could not own James the VII, to be his lawful soverain, 2. Because he taught the unlawfulness of paying the cess expresly [sic] exacted for supressing of the faithful and free-preaching of the Gospel, 3. Because he taught, that it was the people's duty, to carry arms at the preaching of the Gospel (when it was persecuted) for defending of themselves, and resisting of unjust violence.</title>
