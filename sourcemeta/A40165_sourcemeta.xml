      <title>A distinction betwixt the two suppers of Christ namely, the last supper in the same night that he was betrayed, before he was crucified, and the supper after he was risen and ascended at the right hand of God, which he calls people to in Rev. 3. to hear his voice, and open the door, and he will sup with them, and they shall sup with him. Likewise, something concerning Christ the resurrection of the just and unjust. And also concerning the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, which smote the image, Dan. 2. And concerning Christ, the vine; and the Jews, how that God planted them a noble vine, but they degenerated, and destroyed the Lords servants, and son, that came to look for fruits. By G. F.</title>
