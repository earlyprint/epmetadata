      <title>A remonstrance, engagement, and declaration of the officers and souldiers, that either are or have been engaged in the service of the Commonwealth, that are not mercenary janazaries, but desire to approve themselves upright hearted English-men, and Christians and such as would not make shipwrack of faith and a good conscience, in betraying the cause of God and his people to the lusts of men, contrary to their many solemn engagements, declarations, and appeals to Heaven and before men (in the day of their straits) of their faithfulnesse thereunto. And as are resolved in the strength of the Lord to promote, establish, and submit unto the blessed government, laws, and statutes of Jesus Christ their king, Lord, and law-giver. And to maintain and uphold the just rights and liberties of the people in these nations, in subservience thereunto, with the utmost hazard of their lives, estates, and what ever else is near and dear unto them, against all opposers of the same.</title>
