         <title>Couragious Betty of Chick-Lane: giving an account of a fearful battle between her and two thumping taylors, whom she hang'd and lugg'd by the ears till they were forc'd to run to save their lives: and Betty threating to have them prest, they were forced to come to her, begging her pardon upon their knees. To the tune of Lilli-burlero. Licensed according to order.</title>
