      <title>Every mans right: or, Englands perspective-glasse. Wherein may be seen, every mans case, face, birthright, and just liberty. Whereunto is added; the copie of a letter written by a prisoner in the Fleet, unto a worthy member of the House of Commons; expressing the necessitie of justice, and the illegality of imprisonment of men for debt. Composed (primarily) for the meridian of London and VVestminster, and may prove very profitable, to inlighten the eyes of all the commons of England, in this year of our long-expected reformation, and suppressions of injustice, tyranny, and oppression, anno 1646.</title>
