      <title>A learned and notable sermon vpon the text Vos autem non sic. But you not so Lately preached vpon speciall occasion, by M. Butler of Owndell, in S. Maries Church in the Vniuersity of Cambridge: and succinctly debating the chiefe matters, which are now in question in the Church of England. Verie profitable for the further resoluing of them, who being brought into suspence by the contradiction of ministers, are content to lend an indifferent eare vnto the truth.</title>
