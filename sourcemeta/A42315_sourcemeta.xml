         <title>The old Roman Catholik, as at first he was taught by Paul, in opposition to the new Roman Catholick, as of latter he is taught by the Pope the one being apostolicall, the other apostaticall : derived and proven only out of the Epistle of Paul to the Romanes : whereunto is added a clear probation that the same also was the doctrine of the primitive bishops of Rome ... discovering to all clearly the apostasie of that church from the ancient Roman fayth and puritie thereof to the noveltie of gross heresie and idolatrie, and sufficient to convince, if not convert, any papist that is not wilfully obdured / by W. Guild.</title>
