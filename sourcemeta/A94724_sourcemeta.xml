         <title>Tom Nash his ghost. To the three scurvy fellowes of the upstart family of the snufflers, rufflers and shufflers; the thrice treble-troublesome scufflers in the church and state, the onely lay ecclesi-ass, I call generallissimo's. Being like Jobs 3. comforters, or the churches 3. anti-disciples, the clergies 3. persecuters, the states 3. hors-leeches, the divels 3. chaplaines; namely, the Anabaptist, the Libertine, and the Brownist. Written by Thomas Nash his ghost, with pap with a hatchet, a little revived since the 30. yeare of the late Qu. Elizabeths reigne when Martin Mar-Prelate was as mad as any of his tub-men are now.</title>
