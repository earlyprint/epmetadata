      <title>A new letter, to all drunkards, whoremongers, thieves, disobedience to parents, swearers, lyers, &amp;c. containing a serious and earnest exhortation, that they would forsake their evil ways. Shewing also, how many inconveniences the practice of these vices brings upon them, as impairation of good name, destruction of health, ruin in estate, making themselves worse than beasts; rendring themseves clowns and fools, and edious to God and all good men, bringing themselves to untimely ends, and many more inconveniences; but, what is worst of all, ruin both of soul and body in the world to come unless repented of. : To which is added, some rules how to lay the foundation of repentance aright, and how, by the grace of God, to perfect the same. : With exhortations to put all in practice. / By J.F.</title>
