      <title>Wonderful and strange news from Scotland, being a true and full relation of a person lately deceased at the town of Dumfreez, whose corps could by no art of man, or strength of cattle, be removed from the place where it lay. And when the house wherein it was, was wholly burnt down to the ground, the body, coffin, and table whereon it stood, remained whole and untoucht, and so continues to the great astonishment of all spectators. / Faithfully communicated by a person of quality, in a letter from the said town of Dumfreez. Dated Septemb. 8. 1673.</title>
