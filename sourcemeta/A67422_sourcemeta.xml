      <title>Room for the cobler of Gloucester and his wife with several cartloads of abominable irregular, pitiful stinking priests : as also a demonstration of their calling after the manner of the Church of Rome, but not according to Magna Charta, the rule of the Gospel : whereunto is added a parallel between the honour of a Lord Bishop, and the honour of a cobler, the cobler being proved the more more honourable person.</title>
