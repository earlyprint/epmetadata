      <title>A perfect relation of the cause and manner of the apprehending, by the Kings souldiers, William Needle and Mistris Phillips, both dwelling in the town of Banbury in Oxfordshire. Together with their inhumaine usage, whilest they remained close prisoners in the Castle of Banbury. As also the unjust execution of the one, and the barbarous cruelty exercised against the other: being a fit looking-glasse for all misled malignants, to see the clemency and civility of that accursed crew of the cavileers, in that place, and other parts of this Kingdome.</title>
