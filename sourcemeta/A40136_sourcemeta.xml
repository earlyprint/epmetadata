         <title>A clear discovery wherein all people may see who hath been true ministers, and sent of Christ, and who hath been false teachers, and hath run, and the Lord never sent them, these hundred of years past with a warning to all those who persecute them who own Christ come in the flesh, and for conscience sake cannot pay the tenth of their fruits and labours to a changeable priesthood with a letter to all Friends in the truth : also a letter to all ministers whose mouths are opened to preach at the command of men, and to all those whose mouths are stopped, and give over preaching at the command of men.</title>
