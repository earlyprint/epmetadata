         <title>Some briefe considerations on Doctor Featley his book, intituled, The dipper dipt, wherein in some measure is discovered his many great and false accusations of divers persons, commonly called Anabaptists, with an answer to them, and some brief reasons of their practice. In seven sections, viz. I. Dr. Featley his secret and haynous accusing the honourable Parliament. II. That he is guilty of greater errors, than to go into the water to be dipt. ... VI. Some reasons alledged against infants being baptized. A question proposed to consideration, that if it be an error to be baptized again, whether the punishment, some would have inflicted upon them, and some have suffered, be not too great? VII. How many sorts of Anabaptists he saith there are, and what they hold. Whereunto is added, what is conceived the Doctors mysticall frontispiece may more properly declare. / By Samuel Richardson.</title>
