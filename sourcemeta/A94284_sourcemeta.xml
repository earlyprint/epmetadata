         <title>Englands freedome, souldiers rights: vindicated against all arbitrary unjust invaders of them, and in particular against those new tyrants at Windsore, which would destroy both under the pretence of marshall law. Or, the just declaration, plea, and protestation of William Thompson, a free commoner of England, unjustly imprisoned at Windsore. Delivered to his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, and that which is called his Councell of Warre, the 14. of December, 1647. Unto which is annexed his letter to the Generall, wherein the said plea was inclosed. Also a petition to the rest of his fellow-prisoners to his Excellency.</title>
