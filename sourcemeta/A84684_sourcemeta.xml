      <title>A dialogue, concerning the practicall use of infant-baptisme penned, and published for a profitable diversion from the hot and eager disputes of this age concerning the lawfulness, to an holy improvement of the grounds, and practice thereof. As also, for the satisfaction of those who lay it aside altogether, or practise it coldly, and sleightly, because they know not of what advantage it is to a Christian practise. By simon Ford, B.D. and minister to the congregation at Laurence Church in Reading.</title>
