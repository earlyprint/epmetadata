         <title>Mans mortalitie: or, A treatise wherein 'tis proved, both theologically and philosophically, that whole man (as a rationall creature) is a compound wholly mortall, contrary to that common distinction of soule and body: and that the present going of the soule into heaven or hell is a meer fiction: and that at the resurrection is the beginning of our immortality, and then actual condemnation, and salvation, and not before. : With all doubts and objections answered, and resolved, both by scripture and reason; discovering the multitude of blasphemies, and absurdities that arise from the fancie of the soule. : Also divers other mysteries, as, of heaven, hell, Christs humane residence, the extent of the resurrection, the new creation, &amp;c. opened, and presented to the tryall of better judgments. / By R.O.</title>
