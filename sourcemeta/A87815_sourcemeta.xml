      <title>Mr. Knights strange and amazeing prophecy, for three years to come: being, a genuine prepiction [sic] of the most considerable actions and accidents likely to happen in the year, 1699, 1700, and 1701 Fairly deduced from 5 visible eclipses of the luminaries: three great and formidable ones, and two more less more particularly of that great and wonderful eclipse of the sun, which will happen on the 13th day of the next approaching month September, w[h]en 11 digits of the sun's face will be quite darkned, and its effects, or significations more terrible, than that of Black Monday, in the year, 1652. Modestly hinting to all Europe, and every kingdom and state therein, the probable contingencies signified to them, by the signs of heaven. By William Knight, student in astrology, physick, and chirurgery.</title>
