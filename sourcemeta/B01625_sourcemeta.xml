A good wife she is the comfort of a man, if a man be carefull to comfort her again; for love is so rare a thing to see, betwixt man and wife, if they do well agree: but where man and wife do's live at the debate, they say the curse of God do's lye at the gate, therefore honest young men and maids have a care I desire when you are married to live in God's fear: and those that are married and has been long wed, to make much of there wives both at board &amp; at (bed; and let them be carefull they do not offend but be true to their husband to the latter end. To the tune of, The sorrowfull damsels lamentation for want of a husband. This may be printed, R.P.</title>
