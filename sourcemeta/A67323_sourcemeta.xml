         <title>Infants baptism from heaven, of divine institution Being a brief yet satisfactory answer to some objections made by Hercules Collins, in his book entituled, Believers baptism from heaven, infants baptism from earth, &amp;c. against certain truths proved in a book entituled, Baptism anatomized. Propounded in five queries, by Tho. Wall. Viz. 1. What water-baptism is? 2. What is the end for which it was instituted? 3. What giveth right to it? 4. Who are the true administrators of it? 5. Whether it be lawful for a man to baptise himself? Wherein the right that the infants of believers have to water-baptism is vindicated: the duty of believing parents in that matter asserted: and that by the contrary tenet and practice, they ought themselved to be excluded from the Lords-Supper, is plainly and fully proved. And wherein is also proved, that the covenant which God made with Abraham, Gen. 17. and with Israel, Exod. 19. and Deut. 29. are the covenant of grace in Christ, and not part of the covenant of works made with Adam before his fall.</title>
