         <note>Authorship of the Eikon basilike was originally attributed to Charles I, but according to Madan (pp. 125-33) it was written by John Gauden who probably included some authentic writings of the king.</note>
         <note>This is a reprint of chapter 27 of the Eikon. The printer is unknown and the initials C.V. in imprint are probably an invention. -- Madan.</note>
