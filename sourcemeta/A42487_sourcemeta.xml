      <title>Kakourgoi, sive Medicastri slight healings of publique hurts. Set forth in a sermon preached in St. Pauls Church, London, before the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor, Lord General, aldermen, Common Council, and companies of the honorable City of London. February 28. 1659. Being a day of solemn thanksgiving unto God, for restoring the secluded Members of Parliament to the House of Commons: (and for preserving the city) as a door of hope thereby opened to the fulness and freedom of future Parliaments: the most probable means under God for healing the hurts, and recovering the health of these three Brittish kingdomes.
