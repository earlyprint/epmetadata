         <title>Truth made manifest: or, The dead man's testimony to the living Being a compendium of the last sayings, dying speeches, sentences, and expressions, of Captain William Bedlow; that pattern of love to his country. Who deceased at Bristol, the 20th. of August, 1680. Convincing all, both deluded Protestants, and wilfully-blinded Papists, of the realty of that late horrid plot; with his endeared caution both to his King and country, shewing the eminent danger that still threatens. With a sermon made upon this text, preached at his funeral by a reverend divine, Mr. Thomas Palmer.</title>
