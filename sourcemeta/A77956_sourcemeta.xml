         <title>Something in answer to a book called Choice experiences, given forth by one J. Turner. Also the copy of a letter sent to the assembly of those that are called anabaptists in Newcastle. Wherein the simple minded ones may see the deceit of those people, who take up the practises of others, by imitation and tradition from the Scriptures, not having the same commands themselves, as the saints alwayes had, from the spirit of the Lord. And that Christ in the saints, which is their hope of glory, is the same Christ that was crucified by the Jews, who is the lambe slaine from the foundation of the world. Also the difference between the saints who waite on the Lord for the moving if his spirit to be acted, when, and as he please; and formalists of these dayes, who in their owne wills and time practice their imitations of duties and ordinances, which the Lord abhorres. By a servant of the Lord, named of the world Edward Burrough.</title>
