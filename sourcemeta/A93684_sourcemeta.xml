      <title>Rules to get children by with handsome faces: or, Precepts for the extemporary sectaries which preach, and pray, and get children without book to consider and look on, before they leape. That so, their children may not have such strange, prodigious, ill-bodeing faces as their fathers, who (unhappily) became so ill-phisnomied themselves, not only by being born before their conversion, by originall sin, and by being crost over the face in babtisme; but by the lineall ignorance of their parents too in these presepts, for begetting children of ingenuous features and symmetrious limbes. / Composed by George Spinola.</title>
