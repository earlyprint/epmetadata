      <title>Cretensis: or A briefe answer to an ulcerous treatise, lately published by Mr Thomas Edvvards, intituled Gangr&#230;na: calculated for the meridian of such passages in the said treatise, which relate to Mr. John Goodwin; but may without any sensible error indifferently serve for the whole tract. Wherein some of the best means for the cure of the said dangerous ulcer, called gangr&#230;na, and to prevent the spreading of it to the danger of the precious soules of men, are clearly opened, and effectually applied; / by the said John Goodvvin, a well-willer to the saints, in the work and patience of Jesus Christ. Published according to order.</title>
