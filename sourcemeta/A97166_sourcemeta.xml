         <title>A brief narration of the plotting, beginning &amp; carrying on of that execrable rebellion and butcherie in Ireland. With the unheard of devilish-cruelties and massacres by the Irish-rebels, exercised upon the Protestants and English there. Faithfully collected out of depositions, taken by commissioners under the Great Seal of Ireland. Hereunto are added observations, discovering the actions of the late King; and manifesting the concernment of the Protestant-army now imployed in Ireland. Published by special authority.</title>
