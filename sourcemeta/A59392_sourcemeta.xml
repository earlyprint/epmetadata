      <title>Several reasons why some officers of the army with many other good people, did heretofore admit of and subject to Oliver Cromwel as the supreme magistrate of the common-wealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the dominions and territories thereunto belonging : as also, why they did admit of and subject to Richard, the eldest son of the said Oliver, as successor to his father in the government of the aforesaid common-wealth, &amp;c. : likewise, why they have rejected the said government, and earnestly desire the Long Parliament to sit to exercise and discharge their trust in governing the said common-wealth without a single person, king-ship, or House of Lords.</title>
