         <title>O per se O. Or A new cryer of Lanthorne and candle-light Being an addition, or lengthening, of the Bell-mans second night-walke. In which, are discouered those villanies, which the bell-man (because hee went i'th darke) could not see: now laid open to the world. Together with the shooting through the arme, vsed by counterfeit souldiers: the making of the great soare, (commonly called the great cleyme:) the mad-mens markes: their phrase of begging: the articles and oathes giuen to the fraternitie of roagues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggers at their meetings. And last of all, a new canting-song.</title>
