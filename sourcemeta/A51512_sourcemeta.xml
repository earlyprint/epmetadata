         <title>A full account from Ireland, of the maid at Dublin miraculously struck by the hand of heaven, and burning by a supernatural fire; in which deplorable condition she still continues: with her penitent behaviour and discourses since the recovery of her speech. And other remarkable passages relating to this stupendous judgement. As communicated in a letter received by the last post, Jan. 14. from Mr. Mount her master, living in Christ-Church-Yard in Dublin. As also several historical instances in the like kind; published for a warning for all to avoid such prophane execrations. With allowance.</title>
