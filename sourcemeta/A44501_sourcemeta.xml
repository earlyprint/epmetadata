      <title>The Quakers proved deceivers and such as people ought not to listen to, or follow, but to account accursed, in the management of a charge formerly given out against them to that effect, by J. Horne, preacher of the gospel at South-Lin in Norfolke. Which charge was managed and made good by him against George Whitehead, in the chancel of South-Lin, before some hundreds of people, Jan. 13. 1659. to the great baffling of the said George Whitehead and his party, through the merciful and gracious hand of the Lord appearing for his truth and servants therein, as is known to, and witnessed by the generality of the audience of understanding. Published as a warning to all to beware of the said people called Quakers, and their erroneous principles herein also in part discovered.</title>
