      <title>The reformed Virginian silk-worm, or A rare and new discovery of a speedy way, and easy means, found out by a young Lady in England, she having made full proof thereof in May, anno 1652. For the feeding of silk-worms in the woods, on the mulberry-trees in Virginia ... and also to the good hopes that the Indians, seeing and finding that there is neither art, skill, nor pains in the thing, they will readily set upon it, being by the benefits thereof inabled to buy of the English ... all these things that they most desire.</title>
