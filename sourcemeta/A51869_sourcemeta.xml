         <title>Good news to the good women, and to the bad women too that will grow better the like to the men, but here the women are put in the first place, (the which is now out of their place) because this book chiefly treats of the women : shewing what the Scripture saith of the good women, and also what the Scripture saith of the bad women : and for satisfaction to the Jews, herein is proved whose seed it is the serpents head shall bruise.</title>
