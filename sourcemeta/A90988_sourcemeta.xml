      <title>The shepherds prognostication fore-telling, the sad and strange eclipse of the sun, which wil happen on the 29. of March this present year 1652. Which eclipse will begin about eight of the clock in the fore-noon, and so continue till past the hour of eleven; which will be is dismallest day that ever was known since the year 33. when our savior Christ suffered on the cross for the sins of mankind. At which time, the seas did roare, the earth did quake, the graves did open, the temple rent from the top to the bottom, Luk. 23. 45. And there was a darknesse over all the land. This prediction also fore-tells of many strange presages and passages which will follow after that horrible eclipse of the sun, and what wil insue. With a perfect way whereby to avoid the insuing danger. By L.P.</title>
