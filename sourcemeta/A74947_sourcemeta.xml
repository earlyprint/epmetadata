         <title>Rayling rebuked: or, A defence of the ministers of this nation: by way of answer to the unparrallel'd calumnies cast upon them in an epistle lately published by Thomas Speed merchant of Bristol, unhappily become the Quakers advocate. Wherein, some Scriptures are opened, and diverse things objected by the Quakers, examined and answered. With an hortatory epistle prefixed to fasten Christians to Jesus Christ in these un-glewing times, wherein so many play fast and loose with him.
