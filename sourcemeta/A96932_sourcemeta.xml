      <note>On leaf A2r of "To the reader" Workman states that in 1641 he replied to an anonymous work "justifying the practise of Lay-mens preaching." In 1644 John Knowles "owned and subscribed" the anonymous work. Neither Knowles' work nor Workman's (also presumably anonymous) work have been identified.</note>
