      <title>A remonstrance of many hundreds of wel-affected people in the county of Hertford, or, the case rightly stated, between William Hickman late treasurer of the county aforesaid John Woodward, and others their agents and emissaries, and the honest partie of that countie who petitioning against their evil practices, were summoned before the honorable commissioners appointed by order of parliament. Who upon examination, finding them as corrupt in their trust, as uncivil in  their carriages towards the people; honorably turned them out of their places: the county desiring Capt. Rock of Warford (an assertor of his countreys' good) to nominate another treasurer that vvas an honest responsible man, vvhich (vvith approbation of the honorable commissioners) was happily effected, to the great joy of all the vvhole county. With a caveat to all neighbor counties to be carefull, that they be not abused in the same kinde.</title>
