         <title>The ranters principles &amp; deceits discovered and declared against, denied and disowned by us whom the world cals Quakers. With a discovery of the mistery of the crosse of Christ. And a discovery of the true light and the false, with their wayes, worships, natures, properties and effects. &amp;c. A vindication for the truth against the deceit. to clear the truth, of scandalls written for simple ones sake, that desire to know the truth as it is in Jesus.</title>
