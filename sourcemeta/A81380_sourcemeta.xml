         <title>The devill seen at St. Albons. Being a true relation how the devill was seen there in a cellar, in the likenesse of a ram; and how a butcher came and cut his throat, and sold some of it, and dressed the rest for himselfe, inviting many to supper, who eat of it. Attested by divers letters, of men of very good credit in the towne. Whereunto is added a comment, for the better understanding of the unlearned, or ignorant. Printed for confutation of those that beleeve there are no such things as spirits or devils.</title>
