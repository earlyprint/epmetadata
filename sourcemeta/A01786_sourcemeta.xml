      <title>A knowledge for kings, and a warning for subiects conteyning the moste excellent and worthy history of the Raellyans peruerted state, and gouernment of their common wealth: no lesse rare, then strange ... First written in Latine, by Iames Glaucus a Germaine: and now translated into enlgish by VVilliam Cleuer scholemaster. By speciall recorde, this monument was two thousande yeares of antiquity: and so dusked and forworne with age, that being in a plaine writte[n] letter, could scarce be read ... I with my painefull indeuour haue now renewed it into fresh memorye.</title>
