      <title>The moderate enquirer resolved in a plain description of several objections which are summed up together and treated upon by way of conference, concerning the contemned [sic] people commonly called Quakers who are the royal seed of God and whose innocency is here cleared in the answers to the many objections that are frequently produced by their opponents : which may be profitable for them to read that have any thing against them, and useful for all such as desire to know the certainty of those things which are most commonly reported of them / written in behalf of the brethren, in vindication of the truth, by VV. C.</title>
