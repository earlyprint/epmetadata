         <title>A message from the Lord to all that despise the ordinance of Christ which is the power of God unto salvation; with an exhortation to faithfulnesse, which is the cause of true order: shewing the difference of election and reprobation, and the ground of true faith and false, from what centre they doe each of them arise, with order and disorder; and how a believer and an infidell may be known; the believer and the elected ones, as their fruits doe make manifest: with something in vindication by the scriptures, the conditions of the prophets and holy apostles, that those whom the world scornfully call Quakers as many as are born again of water and the Spirit that they are the only people of the Lord &amp; do witness the same conditions that the scriptures doe declare of. Read the scriptures, both of the prophets and holy apostles, in whom the power of the Lord was made manifest, and see their conditions, to whom the Lord did manifest his power: they did both quake, tremble, and shake.</title>
