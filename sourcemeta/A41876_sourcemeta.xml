      <title>Great Britains call to repentance: or, A seasonable exhortation, to a speedy reformation and turning from these crying sins of our age as swearing and prophaning the name of God, and making a sport and game of his sacred Word, and ordinances, lest his vvrath should wax hot against us, and instead of shaking his rod, like a father, he should bring upon us that desolutiou [sic] which the poor island of Jamaco now groans under. Therefore let us speedily repent, for what can we expect, since we have sinned as well as they? Licensed according to order.</title>
