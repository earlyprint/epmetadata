      <title>The scornful maid, and the constant young-man. With mocks and taunts she doth him jear, as in this ditty you may hear; yet no denyal he would have, but still her favour he did crave: yet at the last she granted love, and vowed she would constant prove; yet in this ditty you may find, it is money that doth a bargain bind. Tune of, Times changling I will never be: or, Sawny, or, A fig for France.</title>
