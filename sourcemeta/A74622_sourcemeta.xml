         <title>The path way to peace. Or, A sure means to make wars to cease. According to the prescription of the Lord, and the practice of his servants recorded in his Word. Whereby we may clearly see what duties God hath required of his servants in time of danger and distresse, by reason of war or otherwise; and how they have performed those duties, and how the Lord hath thereupon preserved and delivered them. Worthy to by imitated by all those that do unfainedly desire the peace and welfare of this kingdome. Imprimatur, Ja. Cranford.</title>
