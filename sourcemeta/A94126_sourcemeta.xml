         <title>A Supply to a draught of an act or system proposed (as is reported) by the committee for regulations concerning the lavv: wherein are provisoes against several inconveniences which may befall the free-people of this nation thereby, unless seasonably by the Supreme Power, or otherwise prevented. To which is added, a short treatise of tithes, shewing their original rise, to whom due, how they have been disposed of from age to age; with seasonable proposals for the future preservation and advancement of religion and learning, and setling a competent maintenance for ministers and true labourers therein, for perpetual quiet of the nation. Published by divers officers and souldiers of the Commonwealth and Army, being the second part of their antidote and tendered to the same consideration.</title>
