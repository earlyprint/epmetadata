      <note>(from t.p.) The first, treats of the priviledges they have by the edict of Nantes -- The second, gives an account of some part of the injuries and outrages they do them, whereby to force them to change their religion --The third, proves that their religion inspires no other principle into them, but an unmoveable loyalty to their prince -- The fourth, justifies their innocence against the unjust charge of Monsieur Maimbourg -- The fifth, defends them in relation to those troubles that fell out in Lewis XIII reign, and the affair of Rochel -- The last, shews that the Papists, by the principles of their religion, are guilty of all the crimes, they wrongfully lay to the Protestants, in reference to kings.</note>
