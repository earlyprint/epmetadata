      <title>A warning for swearers by the example of God's judgments shewed upon a man born near the town of Wolver-hampton, in Stafford-shire, who had stolen a Bible; and being examined before a justice, deny'd the fact, and falsly forswore it; wishing he might rot, if he were guilty of the theft; which (according to his desire) immediately fell upon him; and is at this time, a sad spectacle to hundreds that have beheld him: also, a relation of God's judgments shewed upon a woman, who lived in Worcester-shire; who falsly forswore her self, and [illegible] in a short time after, being immediately stuck dumb. J.C. Tune, Aim not too high.</title>
