         <title>A satyrical catechisme betwixt a newter and a Round-head. Also how the Round-head converted the newter, and promised him an excise office. Very pleasing to reade to all those which love God, honour their King, and are their own wel-wishers. With a song. N. stands for newter, and R. stands for Round-head.</title>
