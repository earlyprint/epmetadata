         <note>"Divided into foure parts, 1. Concerning the antiquity of infant-baptism, 2. Concerning the prejudices against antipaedobaptists from their miscarriages, 3. Concerning the arguments from Scripture for infant-baptisme, 4. Concerning the objections against infant-baptisme. In which are maintained these positions, 1. Infant-baptisme is not so ancient as is pretended, but as now taught is a late innovation, 2. Antipaedobaptisme hath no ill influence on church or common-wealth, 3. Infant-baptisme cannot be deduced from Holy Scripture, 4. Infant-baptisme is a corruption of the ordinance of baptisme."</note>
