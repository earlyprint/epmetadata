         <title>Sacred chronologie, drawn by scripture evidence al-along that vast body of time, (containing the space of almost four thousand years) from the creation of the world, to the passion of our blessed Saviour. By the help of which alone, sundry difficult places of Scripture are unfolded: and the meanest capacity may improve that holy record with abundance of delight and profit: being enabled thereby to refer each several historie and material passage therein contained to its proper time and date. / By R. D. M.D.</title>
