      <title>A call and visitation from the Lord God of heaven and earth unto Christendom (so called) who profess they know God, but in works deny him : being also an examination of them, how they came by the name Christian : and its a warning to them all, to repent with speed, before the dreadful judgments of Almighty God (which hangs over their heads) be poured forth upon them ... / through a labourer in the Lord's harvest, and a true lover of all your souls, William Bayly.</title>
