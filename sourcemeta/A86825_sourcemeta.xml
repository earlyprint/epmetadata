         <note>In fact a Catholic tract satirizing the dissenters: "For we want and desire just such a Parliament, as was call'd in forty one --- or that at Oxford, last to secure and preserve the subjects." Includes references to Titus Oates, and the Popish plot: "And that you would please to let our plots be laid upon the Papists, and the real conspirators be pardon'd, by an act of indemnitie,..." as well as to Roger L'Estrange and Judge Jefferies, and others.</note>
