      <title>Sad and lamentable newes from Holland Being a true relation of the great and wonderful inundation of waters, that brake in at the town of Gorkham, in the night-time, near the city of Amsterdam, where many stately houses became bnried [sic] in the violent waves; both men, vvomen and children perishing in the raging billows. Also, the manner how the waters brake in again with great violence, on Munday last about noon, at the two strong sluces of Bonmel and Thieler, where about thirty villages were drowned and not any thing to be seen, but the tops of some few steeples and chimneys, many perishing in the vvaters; some escaping in boats, and the poor infants floating upon the raging vvaves in their swadling-bands and cradles together with the sad and wofull cries and groans of the poor distressed inhabitants; and the ringing of the bells backward, to prevent the perishing of others.</title>
