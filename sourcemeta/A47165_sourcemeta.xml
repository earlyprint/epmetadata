         <title>The Pretended Yearly Meeting of the Quakers, their nameless bull of excommunication given forth against George Keith from a party or faction of men that call themselves the Yearly Meeting, which they would have to be received as the general judgment and sentence of the Quakers ; with a brief answer to the same, shewing that for his zealous and consciencious opposing their gross errors, and reproving the evil and wicked practices of them in Pennsylvania, whom they own to be their breathern, particularly their persecution of G. Keith, and some of his friends, that party has excommunicated him.</title>
