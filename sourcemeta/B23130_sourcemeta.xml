      <title>Nevves coming up out of the north, sounding towards the south. Or, A blast out of the north up into the south, and so to flie abroad into the world: and a warning to all England, and nations elsewhere. The terrible day of the Lord is appearing, that all your hearts must be ript up and laid naked and open before the mighty God, before Him where nothing can be hid, and that no hiding place will be found for him You have hid your selves some in mountains and some in green trees, and some under hills; but the Lord is coming to make all naked, and strip all. / Written from the mouth of the Lord, from one who is naked, and stands naked before the Lord cloathed with righteousnesse, whose name is not known in the world, risen up out of the north; which was prophesied of, but now it is fulfilled: the army is coming up out of the north against you terrible ones, whose weapons are not carnal, but spiritual.</title>
