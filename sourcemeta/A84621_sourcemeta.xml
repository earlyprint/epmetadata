      <title>Naps upon Parnassus. A sleepy muse nipt and pincht, though not awakened such voluntary and jovial copies of verses, as were lately receiv'd from some of the wits of the universities, in a frolick, dedicated to Gondibert's mistress by Captain Jones and others. Whereunto is added from demonstration of the authors prosaick excellency's, his epistle to one of the universities, with the answer; together with two satyrical characters of his own, of a temporizer, and an antiquary, with marginal notes by a friend to the reader. Vide Jones his legend, drink sack and gunpowder, and so fall to't.</title>
