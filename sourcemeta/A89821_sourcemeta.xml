      <title>The navall expedition, of the Right Honourable, Robert, Earle of Warwick, (Lord High Admiral of England) against the revolted ships: being a true and perfect relation of the whole expedition, from their first setting out from Chatham, to their returne againe into the Downes. Also a narrative or briefe relation of the severall acts of Gods providence to the Parliaments fleete, under his Lordships command in the said expedition: together with a detestation of that scandalous pamphlet of joyning or adhearing to the Prince his fleete. All which is published by the severall and respective commanders under his Lordship in vindication of his honour, and themselves: to which they have all set their hands.</title>
