Also a narrative or briefe relation of the severall acts of Gods providence to the Parliaments fleete, under his Lordships command in the said expedition: together with a detestation of that scandalous pamphlet of joyning or adhearing to the Prince his fleete. All which is published by the severall and respective commanders under his Lordship in vindication of his honour, and themselves: to which they have all set their hands.</title>
