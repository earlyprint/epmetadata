         <title>Fratres in Malo, or The matchles couple, represented in the writings of Mr. Edward Bagshaw, and Mr. Henry Hickman; by way of answer to a scandalous letter, bearing the name of Mr. Bagshaw; and to a slanderous libel, fictitiously subscribed by Theophilus Churchman, but proved to be written by Henry Hickman. To which is added a Latine essay, very briefly and plainly reconciling God's pr&#230;science with the free-will of man, which Mr. Bagshaw thought irreconcileable. All in vindication of Dr. Heylin and Mr. Pierce. By one of the meanest of their admirers M.O. Bachelour of Arts.</title>
