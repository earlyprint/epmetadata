         <title>A briefe relation, abstracted out of severall letters, of a most hellish, cruell, and bloudy plot against the city of Bristoll, hatched and contrived by the malignants of the said city, Prince Rupert, George Lord Digby, and their fellow cavalliers, to have massacred, murdered, plundered, and destroyed, not only the well affected in the said city, but all others, that had not the mark of the beast upon them; happily discovered and prevented by the goodnesse and mercy of God, upon Tuesday the 7th this instant March, a few houres before it should have been put in execution. March 13. 1642. Ordered by the House of Commons, that this relation be forthwith printed. H. Elsynge Cler. Parl. D. Com.</title>
