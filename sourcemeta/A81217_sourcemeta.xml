         <note>A satire on Hugh Peters, who was charged with and executed for concerting the death of Charles I. The by-line has caused this work to be attributed to the great expositor of Job, Joseph Caryl. However, this attribution is highly unlikely, and the by-line is also satirical. Cf. Brinley cat., no. 637.</note>
