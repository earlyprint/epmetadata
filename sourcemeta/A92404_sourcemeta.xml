         <title>The converts letter to his old freinds. Or The apologie of a commander of the Kings party, for diserting of that party, and bearing armes for the Parliament. Wherein is shewed, that those pretences of defending the Protestant religion, the fundamentall lawes, the liberties of the subjects, &amp;c. on that party, are but specious. What Irish, and papists, have been honoured &amp; cheifly intrusted. How if that army doth conquer, as it is now moulded, popery and tiranny, of necessity must be introduced. Withe the lawfulnesse of bearing defensive armes by the Parliament. Printed and published according to order.</title>
