Or, the triple presage of Henry Alsted, (a man every way most learned) depending as well on the oracles of heaven, as on the opinions of the greatest astrologers. With an addition of the fiery conjunction of Saturn and Iupiter, this instant February; denouncing many calamities to the world, or certaine regions thereof. In which discourse, is discovered the opinions of many learned men concerning Christs personall reign upon earth, and confirmed by the most comfortable prophecie of Tycho Brahe, touching the most blessed age even now at hand.</title>
