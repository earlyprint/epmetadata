         <title>Repentance too late: being fair Celia's complaint for the loss of her virginity. Or The wronged lover finds no cure but death. Being a pleasant new play song: as it is sung at the theater fair Coelia's kind and trusts too much her Swain, who once enjoying her returns disdain, courts other virgins and neglects her quite what love he had is turned now to spite. For which she grieves at her too quick belief and warns all virgins by her doleful grief, how to beware of man whose false surprize, had ruin'd her then lies her down and dyes. To a pleasant new play house tune called, Sad as death: or, Parthenia unto Cloe cryed.</title>
