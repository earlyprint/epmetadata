      <title>A persuasive to the study of the Revelation, or, An exposition of the three first verses of that prophecy wherein 1. There is an account given of the unintelligibleness of the Revelation ... 2. Dr. Hammond's key ... shewn to be a mistaken one. 3. That neither the Doctor himself, nor anyone else in his time, understood the meaning of those passages. 4. That it can proceed from no better cause than injudiciousness or unskilfulness in these mysteries, to take exceptions at our modern Protestant expositions of the Revelation upon the account of novelty / by Wal. Garrett, rector of Everly.</title>
