         <title>The enmitie between the two seeds: wherein is discovered, the subtilty and envie of the serpents seed: who rules in the man of sin, that is born after the flesh, and persecutes him that is born after the spirit; ... Here is also witnessed (through suffering the losse of all things) the immediate call to the ministry by the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to Scripture. With a testimony of truth to all those that desire to know the way to God, and a discovery of the deceit, with a testimony against it, both in rulers, priests, and people, that do profess God and Christ in words, and in their works denyes him. / Written from the light which the world hates, which they dwelt in who gave forth the Scripture, by one whom the world reproachfully calls a Quaker, not known to the world, but by the name of John Whithead. Here is also a declaration of the ground and manner of my imprisonment, and of the imprisonment of Marmaduke Storr: who is my companion in bonds for the truths sake. With a discovery of their proceedings against us at the two last general sessions holden for the county of Northampton. Here is also, a relation of the proceedings against Thomas Cocket of Dingley, ... the 13. day of the 4. month. 1655.</title>
