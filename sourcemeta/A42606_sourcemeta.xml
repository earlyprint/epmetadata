      <title>A general epistle given forth by the people of the Lord, called, Quakers that all may know, we own none to be of our fellowship, or to be reckoned or numbred with us, but such as fear the Lord and keep faithfully to his heavenly power, that with a holy conversation they may adorn that truth they profess, otherwise, what experience soever they have had of the truth, and are fallen from it, we account them as so many Judasses or Demasses, and own such no more than the primitive Christians owned them; but we testifie against them, and say, such go into perdition through transgression, and fall under darkness into a state of damnation, twice dead, pluckt up by the roots, reserv'd in everlasting chains, until the judgment of the great day, except it be possible they yet can find a place of repentance through God's great unlimitted mercy.
