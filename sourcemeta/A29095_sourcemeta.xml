      <title>The godly exhortation of holy Father Bradford which he gave to his wife, children and friends a little before his death, who dyed a martyr for the Gospel in Q. Maries days : wherein is plainly shown the excellency of the Protestant religion and the happiness of those that profess and live the same : as also the damnableness of the Romish religion with their bloody and rebellious crimes laid open : with the relation of the murder of that just justice Sir Edmund-bury Godfrey.</title>
