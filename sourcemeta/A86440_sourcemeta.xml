         <title>Love, kindness, and due respect, by way of warning to the Parliament of the Common-wealth of England, that they may not neglect to the great opportunity now put into their hands, for the redemption and freedom of these oppressed nations, whom the Lord hath once more appeared to deliver, and hath profered his loving kindness in overturning, overturning [sic] the powers of darkness, that truth and righteousness in the Earth might be established, and Sions people sing and shout for joy. From a servant of the Lord, who hath born in his testimente for the Lord in the day of Apostacy, and hath been a sufferer for the testimonie of a good conscience, by oppressors, under the name of a Quaker.
