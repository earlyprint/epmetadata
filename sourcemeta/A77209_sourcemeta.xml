         <title>An answer to M. Cawdry's two books of the Sabbath, lately come forth Wherein the author doth two things: 1. He vindicates himselfe from Mr Cawdrie's unfriendly abuse of him, in fathering upon him three texts of scripture, and three arguments deduced from them, to prove the perpetuity of the antient Sabbath, ... Wherein the author hath 1. Answered and confuted all that Mr. Cawdry hath wrote to corrupt the sense and meaning of the Commandement. 2. He hath restored the antient, genuine, and proper sense of the Commandement: and confirmed it by sundry undeniable arguments. By Theophilus Brabourne.</title>
