         <title>Certain conscientious queries from Mr. Will. Jenkin being the grounds of his late petition and submission to the present power : whereunto is annexed his petition still very much desired : with the copy of a letter formerly sent to him and Mr. Love with other ministers therein nominated, supplicating their non-ingaging or withstanding Gods stupendious and amazing acts of late and present providences, which if harken'd to in time might have prevented their late sufferings, and better kept up their esteem : also the Parliaments most gracious and indulgent pardon to them all, notwithstanding their acts of treason against the peace of the common-wealth.</title>
