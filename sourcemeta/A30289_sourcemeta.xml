         <title>Three questions resolved briefly and plainly, viz. What conceptions ought we to have of the blessed God? What are those truths, whereof the knowledge appeareth most indispensibly necessary unto our salvation; and (therefore) to be first and most learnt by us? What is the change wrought in a man by God's H. Word and spirit, before he can safely conclude himself pass'd from death to life? Being the summ of three sermons. By Daniel Burgess.</title>
