Or A word to the good people of the three nations of England, Scotland and Ireland, informing them of the abominable apostacy, backsliding, and underhand dealing of the man above mentioned; who having usurped power over the nation, hath most wofully betrayed, forsaken, and cast out the good old cause of God, and the interest of Christ; and hath cheated and robbed his people of their rights and priviledges. / By a late member of the Army, who was an eye, and an ear witnesse to many of those things.</title>
