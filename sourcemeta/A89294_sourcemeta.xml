      <title>More newes from Hull. Or, a most happy and fortunate prevention, of a most hellish and divelish plot, occasioned by some unquiet and discontented spirits, against the town of Hull; endeavouring to command their admittance by casting balls of wild-fire into the town, which by policie and entreatie they could not obtain. Also, the humble petition of the bayliffes, burgesses, and inhabitants of Ludlow, in the county of Salop, under the hands of their corporation, and the liberties thereof.</title>
