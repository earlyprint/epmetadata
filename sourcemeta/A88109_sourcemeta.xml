         <note>A reply to Pendarves, John.  Arrowes against Babylon.</note>
         <note>Pendarves, a Baptist, let fly his arrows (Lond. 1656) at the Church of Rome, the English Church, and the Quakers with admirable impartiality. Ley, an Independent, stands up for Church and Commonwealth and irrelevantly proves Rome to be the Beast, or rather no. 666, by Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and English numeration (p.2). The 'Church of England' he defends: the Quakers are left alone. -- Madan.</note>
