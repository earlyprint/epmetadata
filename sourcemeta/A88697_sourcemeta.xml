         <title>Lanseter's lance, for Edwards'es gangrene: or, A ripping up, and laying open some rotten, putrified, corrupt, stinking matter in Mr. Thomas Edwards his Gangren, or book intituled, The second part of Gangrena. Wherein, amongst others, he hath abused and belied Mr. John Lanceter, calling him pedler, and saying, that he opened the whole book of Ezra, at a privat meeting in stead of opening his pack, which is proved false, and other things also. So that in consideration of the particulars, judicious men may well conceive the cause of his Gangren to be his blind ignorance of the truth, and his mad malice against the wel-affected conscientious people.
