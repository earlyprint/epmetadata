         <title>Proposals for a fund of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds per annum The first fifty thousand pounds per annum, of which, is proposed to be raised by and from a real improvement of the rights and prerogative of the crown. The other hundred thousand pounds per annum, to make the said fund, is proposed to be raised by such, who before they pay it, will be gainers, in happening to be the persons charged herewith, and therefore may with more reason afford to pay it, and think it no burden for being so charged. Most humbly offered to the consideration of the Kings Most Excellent Majesty, and both houses of Parliament. By Thomas Houghton. Lime-street December the 4th 1694.</title>
