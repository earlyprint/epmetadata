         <title>A twofold catechism: the one simply called A Scripture-catechism; the other, A brief Scripture-catechism for children. Wherein the chiefest points of the Christian religion, being question-wise proposed, resolve themselves by pertinent answers taken word for word out of the Scripture, without either consequences or comments. Composed for their sakes that would fain be meer Christians, and not of this or that sect, inasmuch as all the sects of Christians, by what names soever distinguished, have either more or less departed from the simplicity and truth of the Scripture.
