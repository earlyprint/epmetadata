         <title>Antichrists man of vvar, apprehended, and encountred withal, by a souldier of the armie of the Lamb. Otherwise, an answer to a book set forth by one that subscribes his name Edmund Skipp, preacher of the Gospel (as he saith) to a people at Bodenham in Herefordshire; but is found one that is acting Antichrists part disguised: but nakedly seen, &amp; herein discovered in this answer to his book, called the Worlds wonder, or the Quakers blazing-starre. And in this answer he is discovered, and proved to be one that is chief in the service of the old dragon: who pretends in his book to discover the mystery of the Quakers, as he calls them, and to lay open a dangerous design: who is found out, that whilst he hath been pretending to be chief in discovering a plot, or Antichrists misterious actings, is found himself to be the chief plotter, ... / Written in Worcestershire by a servant of the Lord, the second moneth called April, 1655.</title>
