Discovering their unjust exactions, and cruell oppressions of the people; and the good provision made by the law (now in force) to curb their exorbitancy, and the forfeitures and dammages from them that do contrary. With proposalls to prevent this horrid charge and exaction for the time to come, which may be done with great safety and ease to the people.</title>
