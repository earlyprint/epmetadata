An account of what the subduing the rebellion of Ireland, begune the 23d of October, 1641. hath cost, and what damage the Protestants there have sustained thereby, and what lands have been forfeited and disopsed of to adventurers, souldiers, and other English, and what to the Irish, and now in their possession: abstracted out of the accounts of moneys in the exchequer, during such time as any regular accounts were made up, and by probable and rational estimates, for the time in which no accounts were kept, by reason of the general rebellion and confusion, and out of the surveys, deccrees, [sic] and settlements, made by His Majesty's commissioners, for executing the acts of settlement and explanation in Ireland.</title>
