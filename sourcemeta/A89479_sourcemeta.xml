      <title>A notable plot discovered in a letter sent by an agent here in London, to the Earl of Cleveland at the Hague: shewing, how the said agent set the Committee of Mincing-lane on worke, to procure an Act to put out all the old officers of the Custom-house, by which means the Customes will be destroyed. Printed (together with a list of the names of the said committee, and of the officers cashiered, and to be cashiered) for the information of the Commons of England; especially such as hold any offices in the kingdome.</title>
