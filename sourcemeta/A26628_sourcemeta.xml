      <title>An appeal to God and the King together with a true narrative of unparallell'd grievances &amp;c. wherein may be seen as a mirrour ... the surpassing miseries of the English nation above other nations for having the best and most wholesome laws in the whole world, yet being so excessively corrupted by covetousness of money in the law-practicers as now they are ... and unless some expedient be found out for a just and due administration of justice without fee or bride, 'tis impossible for this nation to be happy, but must remain the most miserable nation in the whole world / most humbly presented by Benjamin Albyn.</title>
