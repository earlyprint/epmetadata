      <title>Truth defended. Or, Certain accusations answered, cast upon us who are called Quakers; by the teachers of the world, and the people of this generation. With a cleare discovery, who are the false prophets, and when they came in. And who they are that deny Christ, and that preach another gospel. And who deny the scriptures, churches, ministers, and magistrates, whereby the magistrates and people of this nation may see they justifie that which the scripture condemns, and condemne that which the holy men of God justified. / By a servant of the Lord, whose name in the flesh is, Edward Burrough.</title>
