         <title>Mola asinaria: or, The unreasonable and insupportable burthen now press'd upon the shoulders of this groaning nation: by the headless head, and unruly rulers, that usurp upon the liberties and priviledges of the oppressed people. Held forth in a remonstrance to all those that have yet sound and impartial ears to hear, and duly weighed in the scales of equity and justice ... Wherein is demonstrated, what slavery the nation must subject it self to, by allowing the lawfulness and usurped authority of the pretended Long Parliament now unlawfully and violently held at Westminster. By William Prynne, bencher of Lincolns-Inne.</title>
