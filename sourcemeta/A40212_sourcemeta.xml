      <title>The line of righteousness and justice stretched forth over all merchants, &amp;c. and an exhortation to all Friends and people whatsoever who are merchants, tradesmen, husbandmen or sea-men, who deal in merchandize, trade in buying and selling by sea or land, or deal in husbandry, that ye all do that which is just, equal and righteous in the sight of God and man, one to another, and to all men, and that ye use just weights, and just measures, and speak and do that which is true, just and right in all things, that so your conversations, lives, practices and tongues may preach to all people, and answer the good, just and righteous principle of God in them all, in which ye may be serviceable unto God, and to the creation in your generation, and a blessing both to God and man / George Fox.</title>
