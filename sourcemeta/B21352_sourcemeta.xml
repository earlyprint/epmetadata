      <title>The dreadful and most prodigious tempest at Markfield at Leicestershire, on Thursday Septemb. 7 Where most wonderful stones of hail fell down in the forms of swords, daggers, and halberts. Together with the terrible claps of thunder, and the noise of two armies incounting one another, the canons playing, and muskets shooting incessantly, and the lightning, flashing, and fighting against the lightning: with the dreadful devastation it made on the ground, trees being plucked up by the roots, and walls and houses torn n pieces. Attested by many able persons, and of undoubted credit, who were the sad spectators of it. To which is added the last observation of Sir George Booth: his character, transformation, and his epitaph.</title>
