         <title>The cause of infants maintained, against such as would defraud them of their interest in the church or kingdom of God, or, A reply to Mr. Thomas Grantham wherein both the vanity of his introductive argument with all its absurds, and not only the inconcludingness of, but also the prevarications, fallacies, and falshoods contained in his anwers, are plainly discovered: so, as that all his attempts against infant-baptism greatly fail of evidencing its original not to be from Zion. Written for the undeceiving of all such as thought and cryed up his said answers thereabout as unanswerable: and for satisfaction to all others that are doubtful about the points here in controversie. By I. Horn, sometimes minister of Lin Allhallows in Norfolk.</title>
