         <title>False prophets, antichrists, deceivers which are in the world, which John prophesied of, which hath long been hid and covered, but now is unmasked in these last dayes with the eternal light which is risen ... ; also a word to the heads and governors of this nation, who have put forth a declaration for the keeping of a day of humiliation for the persecution (as they say) of the poor inhabitants in the valley of Lucerna, Angrona, and others professing the reformed religion which hath been transmitted unto them from their ancestors  / by M. Fell ; and also James Milners condemnation upon that which erred from the light.</title>
