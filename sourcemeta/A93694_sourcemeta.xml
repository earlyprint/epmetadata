      <title>An answer to one part of the Lord Protector's speech: or, A vindication of the fifth monarchy-men, in reference to an accusation of evil charged upon them in his speech to the Parliament in the Painted Chamber, the 4 of September, 1654. / Published by John Spittlehouse, to the end all men may see the strong endeavours that have been used to obstruct the kingly interest of Jehovah the Lord Christ in the world, by blowing the bellows of a persecution against those that desire he should reign over all nations of the earth, by his holy, just, and perfect laws and ordinances recorded in the sacred Scriptures to that very end and purpose.</title>
