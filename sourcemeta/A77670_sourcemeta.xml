         <title>A brief survey of the prophetical and evangelical events of the last times: VVherein that which principally is insisted on, is the prophetical little horn, or man of sin, and evangelical beast, and his seven heads and ten hornes. Shewing by the Scriptures what they be, when their rise, what their work, how long their continuance, and their end and ruine. Much differing from former and common interpretations hereupon. Wherein also those prophecies are briefly touched which concern the persecution of the saints, the falling away of the churches, the night of darknesse, the virgins going forth to meet the bridegroom, the mystical whore, the preaching of the Gospel of the kingdome to all the world, and the gathering of the Jewes into their own land. Being a portion of the paines in searching of the holy Scriptures by several members of the congregation of Orpington in Kent. And now published for the comfort of all those that have an interest in the Lord Jesus Christ, and wait, look for, and long after his coming, Tit. 2. 11, 12, 13. / By Capt. John Brovvne a member of that congregation.</title>
