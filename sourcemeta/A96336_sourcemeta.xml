      <title>An alarum sounded forth from the Lord God of vengeance unto England's rulers, mayors, magistrates, and unjust judges, who are found oppressors of the seed and heritage of God: for whose sakes the Lord God is risen to plead, and suddenly will bring destruction on them all, if they repent not; and this I publish in God's authority.</title>
