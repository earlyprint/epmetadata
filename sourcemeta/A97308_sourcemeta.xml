      <title>A word to the officers of the army. Unto you who at first were raised up by a mighty spirit, to go forth with the sword in your hands, to recover some long lost liberties of the good people of England, from under the tyranical powers of Kings and Bishops; unto whom was truly given the title of the Lords Host, because you went forth in his name, and for his people, and therefore were crowned with wonderful successes, and victories, over your enemies, unto a perfect conquest, even unto you is this word of truth.</title>
