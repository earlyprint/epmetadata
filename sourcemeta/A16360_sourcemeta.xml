      <note>Printer's name from colophon; place and date of publication suggested by STC.</note>
      <note>A revised edition, divided into chapters, of "The directory of conscience", first published in 1527.</note>
      <note>This state has the preamble on the title page verso, and a table on G3v, G4r. The first quire, which is a different setting from STC 3275, has headlines, no catchwords, and 32 lines of text to a page like the other quires.  G inner forme is reimposed, with a different setting of the table in place of the cuts. Maybe an earlier issue than STC 3275--STC.</note>
      <note>Reproduction of the original in the British Library.</note>
