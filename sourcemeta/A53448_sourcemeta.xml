      <title>An exact relation of the persecutions, robberies, and losses, sustained by the Protestants of Killmare, in Ireland with an account of their erecting a fortress to defend themselves against the bloody insolencies of the papists : also, the way and manner of their happy escape into England : together with the reasons why the Protestants there did not regiment themselves, and take the field, or make their flight sooner : as likewise, some natural conclusions that plague and famine will arise forthwith in that kingdom / by a principal manager in that action.</title>
