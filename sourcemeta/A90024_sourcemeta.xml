      <title>A nevv remonstrance of the eleven impeached members, declaring the true reasons, why some of them have now chosen to goe into forraigne kingdomes, and others to obscure themselves in this. Also the cleering of themselves from the severall accusations, which since the last answer and vindication have been lately laid unto their charge. Together with their last resolution, and protestation, and their assurance of a happy meeting in the haven of peace, and their re-union, although now disjoyned for a season, by the foul weather of these uncertaine times.</title>
