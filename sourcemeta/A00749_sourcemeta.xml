         <note>Caption title. Place of publication suggested both by STC and Wing.</note>
         <note>There are two settings; stanza 1, line 1 has: (a) "choose" (L, 1 HD) or (b) "chuse" (1 HD). Of the sixteen stanzas all but the last five are about Laud. Since Finch arrived in Holland on 31 December 1640, it is possible that one or both settings were printed in 1641; also entered as Wing O330A--STC.</note>
         <note>STC suggests a publication date of 1640 while Wing suggests 1641.</note>
         <note>Verse - "Reader, I know thou canst not choose but smile".</note>
