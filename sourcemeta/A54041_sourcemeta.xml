      <title>The Jew outward being a glasse for the professors of this age : wherein if they read with meekness... such of them as have not overslipt the day of their visitation, may see their own spirits to their own everlasting advantage and comfort by learning subjection to that which hath power in it to destroy this evil spirit in them : containing some exceptions and arguments of the Jews against Christs appearance in that fleshly form of his in their dayes which the present professors may view and compare with their exceptions and arguments against his appearance in spirit in this age, that they may see and consider which of them are the more and the more weighty / by Isaac Penington, the younger.</title>
