         <title>Murther will out: or, an unrighteous discharge, no security to the murtherer Demonstrating, that notwithstanding those great endeavours, which Sir Harbotle Grimstone, (with the rest of his brethren) used in the second tryal of Mr. Crosby, to secure him from the stroke of justice: and to repair the ruines of their own decayed reputations; yet these two grand designs have altogether failed under their hands; and their projects in this respect have sustained a great frustration and disappointment. Presented to the serious consideration of the said Sir Harbotle, and the rest of the justices who sat with him at the said tryal, Octob. 10. 1662.</title>
