      <title>A pacquet of popish delusions, false miracles, and lying wonders together with many grand divisions among papists: far exceeding both in quality and quantity those among Protestants: notwithstanding their seeming unity. Exposed to the shame of popery. Whereunto is added the papists dissentions from the Protestant: with (that, the enemy so much glorys-in, viz.) the differences of the Protestants among themselves. And, a fearful caution to apostatizing Protestants. By Mercurius Hibernicus.</title>
