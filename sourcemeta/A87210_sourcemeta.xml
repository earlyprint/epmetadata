Or, A true relation of the lamentable sufferings of Mr John Trewman, who by the cruelty of that tyrant, the Earle of Strafford, late lord lievtenant of Ireland, was hang'd, drawn and quarter'd in Caricktargus [sic], for his expressions of love and good will to the Scots, in these late times of troubles. Expressed in an information from the wife of the said martyr, and by two speeches of his own; the one in prison, and the other upon the scaffold.</title>
