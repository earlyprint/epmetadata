      <title>Eutaxia t&#333;u agro&#363;: or A vindication of a regulated inclosure Wherein is plainly proved, that inclosure of commons in general and the inclosure of Catthorp in the county of Leicester in particular, are both lawful and laudable. As also that those evils which do too usually accompany inclosure of commons, are not the faults of inclosure, but of some inclosers only. By Joseph Lee minister of the Gospel.</title>
