      <title>A short, but a strict account taken of Babylons merchants vvho are now forcing the sale of their old, rusty, cankered ware upon the people of these nations : and a stretching them out by their line (which as they say) is the Scriptures in the New Testament, ad they call themselves Christian ministers : also a comparing them with those that spake them forth as their examples that all people may see with whom they run paralel [sic] / by one that hath fed upon the whores flesh these many years handed to him by these merchants and their brethren, but now witnesseth it in him consumed by fire, Richard Crane.</title>
