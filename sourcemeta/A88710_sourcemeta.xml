         <title>Delaun reviv'd, vix. A plain and short discourse of that famous doctor's pills, their use and virtues VVith choice receipts for the cure of the scurvy, dropsy, jaundies, venereal and other diseases. Before I speak to this famous medicine, I will declare who Delaun was; then, the price of his pill and how to take it, and of its several virtues in order, in such plain words, as to the weakest capacity may understand: and I intreat those who hope for help hereby, would throughly read this short book, and observe my directions for their own good and the authors's credit.</title>
