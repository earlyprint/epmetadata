         <title>The faithfull woings [sic] of two conntry [sic] lovers. The young-man he with carriage bold, did oft salute the maiden, and unto her these words he told, his heart with love was laden; and if to him her love she'd grant he'd do his best indeavour. To maintain her she should not want, and he'd forsake her never. Because he was poor the maid was coy, and would not have him entertain'd but at last he became her love and joy, and much wealth with her he gain'd.</title>
