         <title>The hour of God's judgments come and coming upon the wicked world shewing how iniquity will prove the ruin of all people, who do not repent and turn to God, whilst yet they have time : with an exhortation in the love of God to people of all nations, to cease to do evil, and to forsake those provoking sins, that hath kindled the wrath of God, that the judgments now threatning many nations may be turned away.</title>
