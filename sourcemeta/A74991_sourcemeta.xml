         <title>A faithful memorial of that remarkable meeting of many officers of the Army in England, at Windsor Castle, in the year 1648. As also, a discovery of the great goodness of God, in his gracious meeting of them, hearing and answering their suit or supplications, while they were yet speaking to him. All which is humbly presented, as a precious patern and president unto the officers and souldiers of the said Army (or elsewhere) who are or shall be found in the like path, of following the Lord in this evil day; searching and trying their waies, in order to a through return and reformation. By William Allen, late Adjutant-General of the Army in Ireland.</title>
