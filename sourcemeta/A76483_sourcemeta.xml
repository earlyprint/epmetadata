         <title>Mutatus polemo. The horrible strategems of the Jesuits, lately practised in England, during the Civil-Wars, and now discovered by a reclaimed Romanist: imployed before as a workman of the mission from his Holiness. Wherein the Royalist may see himself outwitted and forlorn, while the Presbyterian is closed with, and all to draw on the holy cause. A relation so particular, and with such exquisite characters of truth stampt upon it, that each of our three grand parties may here feel how each others pulses beat. Also a discovery of a plot laid for a speedy invasion. / By A.B. novice. Published by special command.</title>
