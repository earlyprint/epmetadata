         <title>A new discovery of some Romish emissaries, Quakers; as likewise of some popish errors, unadvisedly embraced, pursued by our anticommunion ministers. Discovering the dangerous effects of their discontinuing the frequent publick administration of the Lords Supper; the popish errors whereon it is bottomed; perswading the frequent celebration of it, to all visible church-members, with their free-admission thereunto; and prescribing some legal regal remedies to redress the new sacrilegious detaining of it from the people, where their ministers are obstinate. / By William Prynne of Swainswicke Esquire, a bencher of Lincolns Inne.</title>
