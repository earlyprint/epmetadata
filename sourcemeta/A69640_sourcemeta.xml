      <title>An history of apparitions, oracles, prophecies, and predictions with dreams, visions, and revelations and the cunning delusions of the devil, to strengthen the idolatry of the gentiles, and the worshipping of saints departed : with the doctrine of purgatory, a work very seasonable, for discovering the impostures and religious cheats of these times / collected out of sundry authours of great credit, and delivered into English from their several originals by T.B. ; whereunto is annexed, a learned treatise, confuting the opinions of the Sadduces and Epicures, (denying the appearing of angels and devils to men) with the arguments of those that deny that angels and devils can assume bodily shapes ; written in French, and now rendred into English ; with a table to the whole work.</title>
