Mr. Robert Ram minister, Mr. William Sclater, and Serjeant Horne, all of Spalding in the county of Lincoln, who were taken prisoners by the Cavaliers of Croyland, and kept there the space of five weekes. But are now lately rescued by the Parliaments forces, the town taken with little losse, the forenamed prisoners set at liberty, and many of their adversaries taken in the same net they layd for others. Whereunto is annexed a copy of a letter sent by Mr. Ram to Croyland, which they pretended to be the cause of that their madnesse against him.</title>
