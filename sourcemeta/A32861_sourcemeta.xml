         <title>The Chimney-sweepers sad complaint, and humble petition to the city of London for erecting a new crosse in the room of that stately and beautiful monument voted down by the long-liv'd Parliament, defaced and utterly demolished by the hands of a tumultuous multitude of factious sectaries : also the learned conference between the master, wardens and assistants of the company, upon several occasions at their private meeting at Chimney-sweepers-hall in Old-street, with the declaration and resolution of the maidens and merry lasses of London to stand and stick to them in all things that shall be advantagious to their occupation.</title>
