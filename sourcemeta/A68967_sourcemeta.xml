Anno 1549. Set foorth to the viewe of al louers of the trueth, who openly may see therein, how the same in no wise is perfourmed, (the Lord in his mercie emende it) but to the contrary, in place of getting and preseruing of priuiledges and liberties, they are through the inspiration of the Pope and his allyed, with all crueltie and tyrannie, broken, taken away, &amp; totally voyd. Printed at Delft in Dutch, and Englished by R.V.S. 1581.</title>
