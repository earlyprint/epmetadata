         <title>A plaine relation of my sufferings, by that miserable combustion, which happened in Tower-street through the unhappy firings of a great quantity of gun-powder, there the 4. of January 1650. Now printed that the world may see what just cause I had to complain of the injuries then done me, and how little reason Mr. Glendon minister of that parish had (especially after three years time and more) to defame me in print as a malicious slanderer of him (though I had strong reason to suspect, I did never positively charge with any thing.) Yet he with as much malice as impertinency, hath inserted his vindication (as he cals it) into his epistle to the reader, put a sermon of his, lately printed, entituled, Justification justified; wherein, however, he hath justified his doctrine, he hath condemned himself (as in reference to me) in the judgement of all rationall persons.</title>
