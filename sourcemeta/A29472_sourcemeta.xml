      <title>A Brief relation of several passages of the life and death of William Barton of Shrewsbury, in October, 1661 wherein may be seen much wickedness against great workings of God in him, as also God's most just anger, and wondrous mercy (as is hoped) towards him / published by a relation of his, and intended chiefly for the good of such as knew him in Shrewsbury, many of whom can testify the truth of these things.</title>
