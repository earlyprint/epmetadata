         <note>Although the regnal year is given as "27 Elizabet." it seems possible that this may be an error (by Dyson?); "Cal. S.P.D., 1581-1590", p. 155, lists a letter of 24 Jan. 1584 from Cobham and Randolph requesting Walsingham's signature on orders for the posts in Kent before publication, and the present item probably belongs after 8145--STC.</note>
         <note>Imperfect; as filmed left side of text is illegible.</note>
