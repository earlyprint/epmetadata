      <title>A declaration of John Durie, a minister of Jesus Christ to witness the gospell of peace wherein he doth make known the truth of his way and comportment in all these times of trouble : and how he hath endeavoured to follow peace and righteousness therein innocently towards all : that the offences taken against him, through the mis-construction of some, of his actions may be removed : and the work of peace and unity amongst the Protestant churches at home and abroad advanced in due time.</title>
