         <title>Sir: The summe of what I have heretofore written or spoken to you, concerning the advancement of the mathematickes, is this: as long as men want will, wit, meanes or leisure to atte[nd] those studies, it is no marvaile if they make no great progresse in them. To remedy which, I conceive these meanes not to be amisse.</title>
