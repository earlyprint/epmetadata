         <title>An appendix to the queries upon the 25th of Hen. VIII, Cap. 21 containing some further considerations in behalf of the late illegally ejected officers of the Royal Hospital of St. Thomas Southwark, chiefly grounded upon certain passages in the grant of King Edward VI to the mayor and commonalty of the city of London : wherein the royal perogative as to the visitation and regulation of that and other hospitals is vindicated and asserted : and the late regulations in the time of King Charles II are more particularly consider'd and defended.</title>
