         <title>A confvtation of the new Presbyterian error. Shewing not onely how neere our late Presbyterians come to the Anabaptists, in restrayning the Supper of the Lord from the people, by way of examination, as they doe children from the sacrament of baptisme, by way of confession; but also how they agree with Papists in auricular confession: and that their practise is sacriligious, new, usurped, and tyrannicall. By Alexander Mingzeis, minister of Gods word.</title>
