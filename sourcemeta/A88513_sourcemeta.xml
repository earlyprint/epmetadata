      <title>A long-vvinded lay lecture. Wherein the licentiousnesse of this lewd and lying age, in perverting the sacred texts of Scripture, and the divine dictates of the Fathers, to the scandall of the church, and ruine of our nation, is poetically presented, to the view of all such as feare God and the King, and meddle not with those that are given to change. / By a lover of (and sufferer for) the truth.</title>
