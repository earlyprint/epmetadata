         <title>Tithes a curse to all nations but Canaan, and a disturbance, and vexation to all people but the Hebrevvs. Clearly demonstrated in the case of Isaack Graye, now a prisoner, for the non-payment of tithes in the counter of great Woodstreet, London. Exposed to publick view for the discovering of the cruelties, persecutions, and oppressors of those that stand for it's maintainance.</title>
