         <title>Two general epistles to the flock of God, where-ever they are dispersed on the face of the earth ... to bear testimony for the Lord God against the deceit and deceivableness which the worships of the world have lain in, in the dark night of apostasy : also, pure consolation and comfort proclaimed from the spirit of life to the faithful followers of the Lamb ... with an admonition unto all who are not wholly redeemed out of the earth / written by M.F. and J.P.</title>
