      <title>Some consideration about the nature of an oath more particularly relating to our nationall covenant. Seriously propounded to all who truely feare God, and desire so to walkd with him, that they may enjoy peace of conscience. Wherein this qu&#230;rie is handled: whether the said nationall covenant hath those requisites in it, which according to Gods word ought to be in every oath. The consideration whereof is in this juncture of time the more seasonable, for the said covenant is on the one hand too much adored by some, and on the other hand by others esteemed scarce oblieging, even them who have sworn it. Imprimatur Theodore Jennings Septem. 17. 1649.</title>
