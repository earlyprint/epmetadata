Being a true relation of an excise-man who lately in the county of Kent, had received the sum of fourscore pounds, and lighting into the company of a crafty miss who gave him the chouse for it all; and riding away with his gelding, left in the stead a mare which she had stole; for which mare he was arraigned, and narrowly escaped the severe penalty of the law: which may be a suffiecient warning to all excisemen far and near, to amend their lives to hate a miss, and love their wives. To the tune of, Moggies jealousie.</title>
