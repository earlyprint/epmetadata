         <title>Os ossorianvm, or, A bone for a bishop to pick being a vindication of some passages in a treatise lately published, called Anti-cavalierisme, from the impertinant and importune exceptions of Gr. Williams, the author of the Grand rebellion, calling himselfe by the name of the L. Bishop of Ossory : wherein likewise, the malignitie of severall passages in the said Grand rebellion against the Parliament is discovered, and that question further cleared, how and in what sense kingly government may be said to be the ordinance of God, so that it may indifferently serve for an answer to that whole discourse / by the author of the sayd treatise of Anti-cavalierisme.</title>
