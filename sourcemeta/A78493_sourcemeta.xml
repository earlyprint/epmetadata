         <title>Certain qu√¶res humbly presented in way of petition, by many Christian people, dispersed abroad throughout the county of Norfolk and city of Norwich, to the serious and grave consideration and debate of His Excellency the Lord General and of the General Councel of War. The resolution of which may tend much to the discovery of the great work of God in hand, the union of the godly, and the direction of those worthy instruments imployed in the work. Together with an humble advice for the settling of the kingdom, according to such a model hinted therein, offered as the sence of many Christians, who conceive themselves ingaged (as by their prayers, so) by their councels, to help on the present work of God; desiring it may be examined with all candor, and according as it is found agreeable to the Word of God, may be accepted; or if otherwise, rejected.</title>
