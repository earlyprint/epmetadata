         <title>Amintor's lam[en]tation [for Celia's unkindness.] Setting forth the passion of a young man, who falling in love with a coy lady that had no kindness for him, persued his inclinations so far, that she was forced to fly beyond the sea, to avoid the importunity of his address, whereupon he thus complains. Both sexes from this song may learn, of what they should beware: how in extreams they may discern, unkindness and dispair. To a delicate new tune: or, Since Celias my foe.</title>
