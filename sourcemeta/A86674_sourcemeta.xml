         <title>A true testimony of the zeal of Oxford-professors and university-men who for zeal persecute the servants of the living God, following the example of their brethren of Cambridge. Also the leudness of those two great mothers discovered, who have brought forth so many children, and never had a husband. With a few words to magistrates that persecute the saints, calling them vagabonds; to shew them who are the vagabonds, and to take off their heat who are so much troubled, that they want the honour of a hat.
