         <title>A cal to all the souldiers of the Armie, by the free people of England. 1. Justifying the proceedings of the five regiments. 2. Manifesting the necessity of the whole Armies joyning with them, in all their faithfull endeavours, both for removing of all tyranny and oppression, chiefly tythes and excise, and establishing the just liberties and peace of this nation. 3. Discovering (without any respect of persons) the chiefe authors, contrivers and increasers of all our miseries, especially the new raised hypocrits, by whose treacherous practices, all the just intentions and actions of the adjutators and other well minded souldiers, have been made fruitless.</title>
