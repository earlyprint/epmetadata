         <title>A short declaration of the purpose and decree of the everlasting counsel of Gods heavenly host concerning his royal seed, and noble off-spring, the eternal plant of his own renown, the everlasting covenant of light, and of the arraignment of all that wilfully oppose and fight against it, at the barr of Gods righteous judgement : with a warning to them to repent, and to fear and dread the infinite, eternal God, who will undoubtedly set up His Son, His light, life, spirit, and seed over all to reign in the pure dominion and authority in the kingdoms of men.</title>
