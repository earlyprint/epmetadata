         <title>A scriptural catechism The heads of the Christian religion plainly, briefly, and fully delivered in a catechism, which endeavours a sufficient answer to every question, barely with a pertinent sentence of sacred scripture, and enables the learner at once with ease to confirm as well as assert the great articles of the faith once delivered unto the saints. By Cotton Mather.</title>
