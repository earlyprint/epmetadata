         <title>The dangerous condition of the United provinces prognosticated and plainly demonstrated, by Mr. William Lilly, in his observations of that comet which appeared in the year of our Lord, 1652. And published in his annual predictions in the year 1654, &amp;c. Together with some hints, and touches, of the most inhumane and unparaleld crueltyes committed by the Dutch upon our English-men at Amboyna, Polaroone, and Lantore in the East-Indies. With several proofs of their insolencies, ambition, and avarice. Written for the satisfaction and incouragement of all such as have not already been convinst of their perfidious dealings. With allowance,</title>
