      <title>A northern blast, or the spiritual Quaker converted: being soul-saving advice to the giddy people of England, who are running headlong to destruction. Wherein is shewed the manner of their meetings, in the county of Yorkshire, and Durham, their quakings, skreekings [sic] and ridiculous actions; also their fond and false restings of the scriptures. With a full examination, conviction of their tenets. / By G. Emmot, of Durham gent. formerly a brother amongst them, but now (by the help of God) converted, and established in the truth.</title>
