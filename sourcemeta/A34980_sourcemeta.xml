      <title>Christ exalted and Dr. Crisp vindicated in several points called antinomian, being cleared from neonomian suggestions alledged, by some remarks on Mr. A-, his rebuke to Mr. Lob shewing from Scripture and most orthodox authors the invalidity of his rebuke in taxing the doctor to be apocryphal, and his doctrine antinomian : with some observations on the Bishop of Worcester's letter concerning the great point of the change of persons between Christ and believers ... : with a table to find the heads insisted on / done by a happy, tho' unworthy branch of the said doctor.</title>
