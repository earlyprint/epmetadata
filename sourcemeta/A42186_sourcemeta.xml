         <title>A glass for the people of New England, in which they may see themselves and spirits, and if not too late, repent and turn from their abominable ways and cursed contrivances that so the Lord God may turn away his wrath, which he will bring upon them, it they repent not, for their blasphemies against himself, and for all the murders and cruelties done to his tender people, ever since they usurped authority to banish, hang, whip, and cut off ears, and spoil the goods of dissenters from them in religious matters, while themselves disown infallibility in those things / by S. G.</title>
