      <title>A call into the way to the kingdom. This is written to go abroad into the world, for the good of poor soules, that they may know the way to their soules rest. / Written by Thomas Stubbs, one whom the people of the world scornfully calls Quakers; which word quaking I willingly own, else I should deny the Scriptures: for Moses and the holy men of God quaked and trembled at the presence of the Lord. Heb. 12, &amp;c.</title>
