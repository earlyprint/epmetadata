         <title>The fanatick history: or an exact relation and account of the old Anabaptists, and new Quakers. Being the summe of all that hath been yet discovered about their most blasphemous opinions, dangerous pactises [sic], and malitious endevours to subvert all civil government both in church and state. Together with their mad mimick pranks, and their ridiculous actions and gestures, enough to amaze any sober christian. Which may prove the death &amp; burial of the fanatick doctrine. Published with the approbation of divers orthodox divines.</title>
