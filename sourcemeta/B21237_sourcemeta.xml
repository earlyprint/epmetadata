      <note>Attributed to Dudley Diggs. cf. NUC pre-1956.</note>
      <note>This defense of the divine right of kings, in reply to Henry Parker's "Observations", 1642 has been attributed to Diggs by DWB and Wood-Bliss, Athenae Oxonienses, but the attribution is doubted by Madan on reasonable grounds and is not to be confused with Digg's "An answer to a printed book", 1642.</note>
