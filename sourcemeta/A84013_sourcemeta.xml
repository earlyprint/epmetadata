         <title>The English devil: or, Cromwel and his monstrous witch discover'd at White-Hall: With the strange and damnable speech of this hellish monster, by way of revelation, touching king and kingdom; and a narrative of the infernal plots, inhumane actings, and barbarous conspiracies of this grand impostor, and most audacious rebel, that durst aspire from a brew-house to the throne, washing his accursed hands in the blood of his royal soveraign; and trampling over the heads of the most loyal subjects, making a foot-ball of a crown, and endeavouring utterly to extirpate the royal progeny, root and kinde, stem and stock.</title>
