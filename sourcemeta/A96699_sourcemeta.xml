         <title>A vvatch-vvord to the city of London, and the Armie: wherein you may see that Englands freedome, which should be the result of all our victories, is sinking deeper under the Norman power, as appears by the relation of the unrighteous proceedings of Kingstone-Court against some of the Diggers at George-hill, under colour of law; but yet thereby the cause of the Diggers is more brightened and strengthened: so that every one singly may truly say what his freedome is, and where it lies. / By Jerrard Winstanly.</title>
