      <title>A cry for repentance, unto the inhabitants of London chieflie, and unto all the vvorld, whose fruits do shame their profession, and that they may come to yea and nay, in all their communications and dealings, that their life may judge the world; for who are out of that, are in the evil, and falls into the condemnation of the Devil. Given forth for the information of the simple, that they may know the way of life, and out of the evill communication which corrupts good manners.</title>
