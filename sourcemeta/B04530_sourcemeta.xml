      <title>Natures wonder? Or, [An ac]count how the wife of one John Waterman an ostler ... was delivered of a strage monster upon the 26th of October 1664 ... It had two heads, foure armes, and two legs ... She had another child born before it ...which is yet living, and is a very comely child in all proportions. This is attested for truth, by several persons which were eye witnesses. The tune is, London prentice: Or, Jovial batchelor.</title>
