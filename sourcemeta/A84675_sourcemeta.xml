      <title>Seasonable and usefull directions, how to comfort and cure the afflicted, both in all outward afflictions on the body, estate, name, or friends, &amp;c. And also in all inward afflictions on the conscience, occasioned either by Satans temptations, or our owne sinnes. More especially applyed to these three particulars, viz. from 1. the feare of committing that unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost. 2. Hardnesse of heart accompanyed with the feare of hell. 3. A wounded spirit under the sense of wrath, and Gods displeasure. / Written in a letter to a Christian friend, by that late godly, learned, and soule-supporting minister of the Gospel, Mr. John Forbes. Imprimatur, Ja. Cranford.</title>
