         <title>The vanity and falsity of the history of passive obedience detected Wherein is briefly demonstrated, that the first reformers were far from maintaining it in the author of that history and his party's sence. As also it is plainly evinced that it cannot be deduced from the homilies, articles, injunctions or canons, liturgy and bishops of the primitive English Church. And all the specious pretences he makes for it are fully answered. By Tim. Wilson, M.A. and rector of the Kings Noth in Kent. Licens'd according to order.</title>
