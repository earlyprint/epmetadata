Paralleld with those of Spaine, and other forraigne countries, with some other modest conjectures, at the causes of the said distempers, and their likeliest cure. / Written by a loyall subject to His Majestie, and a true servant of the Parliament, in vindication of that aspersion cast upon them, for declining His Majesties royall prerogative, or seeking to confine it to limits. By H. G. B. L. C.</title>
