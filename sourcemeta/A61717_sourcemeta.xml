         <note>Caption title.</note>
         <note>An odd and rare little piece, the only known copy of which is in the Bodleian Library. [The author's] idea is that three chapters of the Bible should be read each day, at morning, noon and night ... The table deals with every day of the year, but Feb. 29 is left to the 'discretion and piety' of the reader. Cf. Madan.</note>
