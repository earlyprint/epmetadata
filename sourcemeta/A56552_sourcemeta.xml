      <title>The door of salvation, opened: or, A voice from heaven, to unregenerate sinners Plainly shewing the necessity of opening your hearts to Christ, or else he will open Hells mouth to devour you. VVith many sweet invitations to come to him, that they might have life, and be hidden from the wrath of God, which is worse than death. Together with the dreadful condition of the stubborn and hard-hearted sinners. Dealing impartially with their souls, propounding blessing and cursing, life and death; salvation if you open to Christ, damnation if you refuse Christ. By T. P.</title>
