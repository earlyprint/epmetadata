         <title>A Declaration of the affections, intentions and resolutions of our brethren in Scotland for the peace and safety of both kingdomes. Whereby, the reader may observe how the present condition of this kingdome runs paralell [sic] with theirs then. God grant us now the like courage, affections, and resolutions, not to betray our King and Parliament, and therein, our religion, lawes, liberties, estates, lives, and the whole kingdome, vnder a blinde and false pretence of standing for the King, and so to betray all to the will of our perfidious enemies.</title>
