      <title>Holy time: or, The true limits of the Lords Day I. Proving, that the Lords Day doth begin with the natural morning, and that the morning of the natural day doth begin at mid-night; and so consequently that the Lords Day must both begin with the natural morning at mid-night, and end with the natural evening at mid-night. II. Proving, that the Jews beginning of the day at the sun-set evening was only in relation to the date of the person purified from his levitical uncleanness. III. That the Jews themselves did hold, that the natural day did continue after sun-set till mid-night. Part II. By William Pynchon Esq; Published by authority.</title>
