In the preface (A2 verso) the author speaks of himself as distinct from the author of the, likewise anonymous, book which it supports ("A counter-poyson, modestly written for the time, to make aunswere to the objections and reproches, wherewith the aunswerer to the Abstract, would disgrace the holy discipline of Christ" (STC 10770)), which is also variously attributed to Fenner, Stoughton and Jacob.</note>
