         <title>A short view of the Antinomian errours with a briefe and plaine answer to them, as the heads of them lye in order in the next page of this book : being a nest of cursed errors hatched by hereticks, fed and nourished by their proselites : being taken as they were flying abroad were brought as the eagle doth her young ones to see if they could endure to looke upon the sun-beams of truth with fixed eyes, the which they could not : were presently adjudged to be a bastard brood, and their necks chopt off, and their carkasses throwne to the dunghill.</title>
