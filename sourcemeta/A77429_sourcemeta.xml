Propounded to the consideration of wise conscientious and peacable minded men. And intended as a testimony to Jesus Christ, who having all power in heaven and in earth, placed in his hands whilest he is putting down all principalities and powers as they are enemies to him that hath such a kingdome to set up, as of the increase of his government, and of peace there shall be no end.</title>
