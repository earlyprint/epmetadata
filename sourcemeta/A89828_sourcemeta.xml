      <title>An ansvver to twenty eight queries, sent out by Francis Harris to those people he calls Quakers: wherein his spirit is tryed, to be contrary to that spirit that was in all the children of Light, by his own words and infallible proof: his slanders being removed, his queries are groundless: and so the truth cleared, in the sight of the least of the Lords people. / Written in defence of the truth: and for the freeing the Israelite out of the hand of the &#198;gyptian.
