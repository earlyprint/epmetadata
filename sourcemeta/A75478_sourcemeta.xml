      <title>Anti-Quakerism, or, A character of the Quakers spirit, from its original and first cause. / Written by a pious gentleman that hath been thirteen years amongst the Separatists to make observations, and is now returned home with a full intent to lay open the whole mystery of iniquity, in unvailing the whore, that men may no longer drink of the wine of her fornications; he hath vowed a single life, and given himself up wholly to the exercises of the mind. And here he hath described the spirit of Quakerism. 1. Being a precise Puritan. 2. An Anabaptist. 3. A Seeker. 4. A Ranter. 5. A Quaker, and indeed what not, all things, and nothing. By which character every man may in some measure see the deceitfulness of his own imagination and be careful, and watch himself accordinly [sic].</title>
