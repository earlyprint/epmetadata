      <title>According to His Majesties especial command to me signified for avoiding the great dangers happening by fire. That all persons having lodgings within His Majesties palace at Whitehal, should have so many leather boquetts, as there are chimneys within their respective lodgings; and that the same be kept there in readiness upon all occasions.</title>
