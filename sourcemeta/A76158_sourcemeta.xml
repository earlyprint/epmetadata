      <title>Confirmation and restauration, the necessary means of reformation, and reconciliation; for the healing of the corruptions and divisions of the churches submissively, but earnestly tendered to the consideration of the soveraigne powers, magistrates, ministers, and people, that they may awake, and be up and doing in the execution of so much, as appeareth to be necessary as they are true to Christ, his Church and Gospel, and to their own and others souls, and to the peace and wellfare of the nations; and as they will answer the neglect to Christ, at their peril. By Richard Baxter, an unworthy minister of Christ, that longeth to see the healing of the churches.</title>
