      <title>A true narrative and manifest set forth by Sir Robert Walsh knight and Batt. which he is ready all manner of ways to justify as relating unto Plots, designs, troubles and insurrections, which were intended to have been set a foot, towards the subversion of His Most Excellent Majesties laws and government, not by a private information, or other, but before any court of Justice, discipline ; either in the civil, common, or marshal law and to reply or disanul the printed paper, in part of Edmund Everard and Irish man, who was so long prisoner in the tower : and to make out why he was so detained, nothing relating to the plot but was for his intent to have poysoned the Duke of Monmouth as shall more amply be made out in this manifest.</title>
