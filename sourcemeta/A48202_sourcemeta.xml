      <title>A letter to a member of the Honourable House of Commons in answer to three queries : I. Whether there is no other cause of our want of bullion and coin, but the clipping of our money, and the expence of the war, II. Whether it is possible to manage the trade of the nation without a supply in specie, equal to what we have lost, III. Whether a forc'd credit can be an expedient under our present circumstances : with some other remarks, in relation to our own, and foreign manufacturies.</title>
