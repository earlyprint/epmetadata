         <title>A defence of Catholikes persecuted in England invincibly prouing their holy religion to be that which is the only true religion of Christ; and that they in professing it, are become most faithfull, dutifull, and loyall subiects, to God, their King and country. And therefore are rather to be honoured and respected, then persecuted or molested. Composed by an ould studient in diuinitie.</title>
