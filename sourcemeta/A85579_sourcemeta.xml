Also the cruel and bloudy proceedings of the Dutch against the English, the taking of the Parliaments dove, and their resolution to tie all English-men to the mouth of their canon, that will not fight against the Parliament. Likewise, the proceedings of the Lord Craven in Holland, the uniting of the English, and the agreement made between the King of Scots, and the Estates Generall.</title>
