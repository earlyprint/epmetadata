         <title>Mirt[h] in abundance Set forth and made manifest in many jests, upon severall occasions, full of wit and truth. Contriv'd to relieve the melancholy, and rejoyce the merry; to expell sorrow, and advance jollity. All of them new and noble, free from rayling baudery, blasphemy, or incivility. Collected and set together by a lover of lawfull mirth, and true hearted society.</title>
