      <title>Theauraujohn his Theous ori apokolipikal: or, Gods light declared in mysteries Salem ori ad te Israel. Theauraujohn Tanni. Dedicated to the army and the risen people in all lands, coming forth in the first fruits in the evangelical operation. To these is the dedication of this book; and their eyes behold the truth, none else. I have added to this book the particular charges in the indictment against Captain Robert Norwood and my self, and my defence against the charge.</title>
