      <title>Sir Francis Seymor his honourable, and worthy speech, spoken in the high court of Parliament shewing what dangers doe insue by want of priviledge of Parliament. And how the splendor of His Majestyes glory is eclipsed with toleration of Iesuits, seminary priests, and bad ministers who still have abiding amongst us. As also, such who have betrayed the King unto himselfe, to bring the subjects under slavery. Whereby the King can neither be preserved in honour, nor the Common-wealth in safety whereunto is annexed, Sir Walter Earle his paraphrase, concerning Bishop White.</title>
