         <note>"Wherein is contained a true relation of certain English persons who, in Queen Elizabeths time, making a voyage to the East Indies, were cast away and wracked near to the coast of Terra Australis Incognita and all drowned except one man and four women.  And now lately Anno Dom. 1667, a Dutch ship making a voyage to the East Indies, driven by foul weather there, by chance have found their posterity (speaking good English) to amount (as they suppose) to ten or twelve thousand persons.  The whole relation ... is here annexed with the longitude and latitude of the island, the scituation and felicity thereof with other matter observable."</note>
