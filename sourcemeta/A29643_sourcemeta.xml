      <title>A thundering voice out of Sion yet a tender visitation sounding forth to awaken all sorts of professors in this nation of England (and dominions thereof) who are scattered in the many by-wayes, sects and opinions, crying, lo here, and lo there, seeking the kingdom of God (which is not of this world) with outward observation : more especially intended and directed unto those people who have separated themselves ... / given forth by a souldier in the army of the lamb, who is in outward bonds in the prison-house, called New-Prison, and known by name, Daniel Baker, though by the scorners called Quaker.</title>
