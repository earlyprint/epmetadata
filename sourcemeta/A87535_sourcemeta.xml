         <title>A recantation of Iudge Jenkins, a reverend and learned father of the lawes, delivered at Westminster, the 10. of April 1647. to Mr. Corbet the Chaire-man of the Committee of Examination, with his name subscribed thereunto. Wherein he humbly submitteth himselfe to the power assumed by the two Houses of Parliament, in opposition to the Kings authority; together with a vindication of the negative oath imposed by the power and authority of the two Houses. Published for the satisfaction of tender consciences, who pretend the unlawfulnesse of taking the said negative oath.</title>
