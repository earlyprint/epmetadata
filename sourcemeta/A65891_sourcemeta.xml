         <title>The true light expelling the foggy mist of the pit and the gross confusion and blasphemy of the beast, which is gone forth against the light of Christ and the scripture within, from an old professor, called Francis Duke of Westminster, in his book stiled, An answer to some of the principal Quakers, who therein boasts as if he had a great skil in divinity so that his pretended divinity in the said book is here discovered, and the true light and scripture within here vindicated from his gross aspertions cast upon the light, and them that walk in it / by George Whitehead.</title>
