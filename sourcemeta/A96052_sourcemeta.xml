         <title>A most worthy speech, spoken by the Right Honourable Robert Earle of Warwicke; in the head of his army, November, 22. when he tooke his leave of them, and delivered them under the command of his excellence the Earle of Essex. Wherin is contained all the duties of a Christian souldier, both toward God and man, with many religious advertisements, to deterre them from swearing, and taking the name of the Lord in vaine. Whereunto is annexed a caveat for the cavaliers, being a true example of Gods judgement against one of that crew, which tooke a pride in blaspheming against God, and cursing the Roundheads.</title>
