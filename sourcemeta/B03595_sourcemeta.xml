         <title>The glorie of the Lord arising, shaking terribly the earth, and overturning all, until righteousness be set up. Being an encounter with the ministers of the world touching their maintenance; wherein they are beaten with their own weapons, confuted by their own scriptures and arguments. Also, a testimony from the Lord against swearing. With a word to the heads of the nation, and to the judges of life and death. By those whom the world calls Quakers.</title>
