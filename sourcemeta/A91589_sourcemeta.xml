Or, The Quakers antiquering advocate examined: his pleadings found light and weake, his language lewd and railing, his prinicples loose and large. The quaking and entransed faction discovered to be a new branch of an old root, revivied by Satan; some of their strange ungospel-like tenents, unchristian practises, and opinions fathered upon the spirit, to be abhorred, and avoided by all holy soules, are also discovered, and truly laid open.</title>
