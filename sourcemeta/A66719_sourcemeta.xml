      <title>The chasing the young quaking harlot out of the city, or, A turning the Quakers dark side into the light wherein is plainly discovered a twofold design against the publick peace, the one by their doctrine, the other by their sword : with an answer to E. B. Salvation to his brethren : the Quaker founded out of his lying trumpet : with seven special marks to know the quaking harlot from the other harlots : also certain queries sent to I. Lilburn, in order to prove his resurrection to be but a meer imagination, and quaking delusion : together with a certain rule to know whether the Quakers doctrine be a new dispensation of Gods, or a fiction out of a Quakers brain / by Thomas Winterton.</title>
