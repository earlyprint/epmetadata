B. Salvation to his brethren : the Quaker founded out of his lying trumpet : with seven special marks to know the quaking harlot from the other harlots : also certain queries sent to I. Lilburn, in order to prove his resurrection to be but a meer imagination, and quaking delusion : together with a certain rule to know whether the Quakers doctrine be a new dispensation of Gods, or a fiction out of a Quakers brain / by Thomas Winterton.</title>
