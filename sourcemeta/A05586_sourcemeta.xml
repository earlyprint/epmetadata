         <title>Two most srange [sic] and notable examples, shewed at Lyshborne the 26. day of Ianuarie now last past The one by striking dumme two of the cheefe of the holy-house, as they were pronouncing the sentence of death against two English Mariners, vnto whom they had offered great promotion, to haue them to serue against the King of France, and their owne countrie. The other within sixe dayes then next following, by burning two ships of corne in the harboure there, which was brought out of France to releeue the King his enimies: an example most wonderfull. ... Affirmed for truth by those men vnder named, of honest reputation, being present at the dooing thereof, the one maister of the ship called the Fortune: the other maister of the Flying Harte.
