      <title>England's Ichabod, glory departed, discoursed by two Christian men, zealous for the glory of God, and true lovers of their nation: the one called Heraclitus junior, weeping for and lamenting the inevitable wo and desolation impending and approaching on his native country. And the other called Democritus natu minimus, laughing at the ignorance, blindness, madness, and inexorable stupidity of his own nation, overwhelmed in folly, sin, and wickedness, insensible of its own ruine and misery. Both of them paradoxically praising the Jesuites, and their spurious seed, for their policie, activitie, and dexteritie, in promoting their factions and projects. / By Heraclitus junior, and Democritus natu minimus, for Ri: Fosterschism.</title>
