         <title>A new and cleer discovery, of the true, and proper, natural cause, of the ebbing and flowing of the main sea. Convincingly held forth, both from Scripture and reason. So as any rational man, may easily apprehend, the proper cause on its flucnt [sic] motion: and that it is not the Moon, as some have imagined, and gone about to prove. / Written by Ellis Bradshawe of the Parish of Boulton in the County of Lancaster, Husbandman.</title>
