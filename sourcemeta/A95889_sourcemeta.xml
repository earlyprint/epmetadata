         <title>A just correction and inlargement of a scandalous bill of the mortality of the malignant clergie of London, and other parts of the kingdome, which have been justly sequestred from their pastorall-charges, and since that (some of them) defunct, by reason of the contageous infection of the prelaticall pride and malignancie of their owne spirits; since the yeare 1641. to this present year 1647. Together with the severall pernicious casualties of the same. Or, A succinct traiterologie, in answer to a lying martyrologie, and catalogue of the gracelesse, and godlesse, lazy Levites, and proud prelaticall priests of the City of London, and beyond the liberties thereof, who have been justly imprisoned and deprived of their estates ... Serving for London, especially, and the liberties thereof, with the out-parishes; together with most parts of the whole kingdome, both city and country. / By J:V.</title>
