      <title>Sions rock exalted over all the earth to raign: and the worlds foundation discovered, which he will overthrow, with all its builders and buildings. / Moved of the Lord, and given forth (by a sufferer for the righteous seed sake, in the common goal of Edmonds-Bury in Suffolk, who is scornfully called a Quaker) for the manifesting the true foundation of our religion, and the laying open deceit, and deceivers, to all that desire to know the truth, and to be delivered out of deceit, and the snare of the wicked one, in which the deceivers and deceived are held captive. And to all you priests, that you may see your deceit, and cease from it, and deceive the people no longer.</title>
