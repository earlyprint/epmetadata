      <title>Jack Had-Lands lamentation, that sold and made away his 'state, and spent his money early and late; and let his wife and children want, now he makes great moan and does repent; and desires all good-fellows where e're they be, to take warning of his poverty. He was cast in prison at that bout, his poor wife she helpt him out; she had small reason to do that thing but true love is a gallant thing; there is scarce a tap-house in London town. Will help a man when he is cast down. To the tune of, It is old ale that has undone me. This may be printed, R.P.</title>
