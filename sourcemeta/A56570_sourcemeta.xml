         <title>Living words through a dying man being a melodious song of the mercies and judgments of the Lord, sung by a disciple of Christ on his dying bed, when the pangs of death were upon his outward man. With an arrow shot against Babylon, being a direct prophecy of the downfal of her merchants, the hirelings and false prophets. With sweet exhortations and prophecies also of the spreading of the glorious truth of God, until it shall have covered the face of the whole earth. By one who dyed a prisoner for the testimony of Jesus, Francis Patchet.</title>
