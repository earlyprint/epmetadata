         <title>A treatise of the two sacraments of the Gospell: baptisme and the Supper of the Lord Divided into two parts. The first treating of the doctrine and nature of the sacraments in generall, and of these two in speciall; together with the circumstances attending them. The second containing the manner of our due preparation to the receiving of the Supper of the Lord; as also, of our behaviour in and after the same. Whereunto is annexed an appendix, shewing; first, how a Christian may finde his preparation to the Supper sweete and easie: secondly, the causes why the sacrament is so unworthily received by the worst; and so fruitefly by the better sort: with the remedies to avoyd them both.
