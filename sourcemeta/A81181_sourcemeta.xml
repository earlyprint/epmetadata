         <title>A cup of sack prest forth of the best grapes gathered the last vintage, in the loyall converts new distempered vineyard. Which by frequent using, will make an old lame capon-eater, able to shake his legs, and dance as roundly and as nimbly; as a boy of 18. years of age. Published for the good of those that are so distempered through malignant humours; who may be cured at a cheap rate.</title>
