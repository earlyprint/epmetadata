      <title>Mr. De Labadie's letter to his daughter, Mrs. Delabadie, nurse to the pretended Prince of Wales written in characters and deciphered by Dr. Wallis ... : which said letter is referred to by Mr. Fuller in his two narratives, and is a plain demonstration of that horrid imposture : with reflections upon it, and a full answer to the material objections, in a late pamphlet entituled, The truest account of Mr. Fullers discovery, &amp;c. / by another hand.</title>

      <note>Probably by William Fuller; Mary Anne de Labadie, nurse to James II's son, was the wife, not daughter, of James de Labadie, James's valet; but the circumstances of discovery (p. 3-4), if authentic, make it appear unlikely that he was the author. Cf. NUC pre-1956.</note>
