         <title>The re-publicans and others spurious good old cause, briefly and truly anatomized. To preserve our native country, kingdom, legal government, Church, parliaments, laws, liberties, privileges of Parliament, and Protestant religion from ruine, scandal, and perpetual infamy; to reform, reclaim all Jesuit-ridden seduced republicans, officers, soldiers, sectaries, heretofore, or now engaged in the prosecution of this misintituled good old cause, from any future pursute thereof, and engage them for ever to abominate it, as apparently tending to publike ruin, their own temporal and eternal condemnation, infamy, our religions reproach, in present and succeeding ages. By William Prynne Esq; a bencher of Lincolns Inne.</title>
