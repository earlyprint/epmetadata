         <title>The divine authority of the Scriptures asserted, or the great charter of the worlds blessednes vindicated. Being a discourse of soveraigne use and service in these times; not only against that King of Errours, and Heresies Anti-scripturisme, who hath already destroyed the faith of many, and hath all the faith in the world yet remaining, in chase, but also against all such inward suggestions and secret underminings of Satan, by which he privily attempteth the ruine of the precious faith and hope, wherewith the saints have built up themselves with much spirituall industry and care. Together with two tables annexed; the former, of the contents, and severall arguments more largely prosecuted in the treatise; the later, of such texts of Scripture unto which some light is given therein. / By John Goodvvin a servant unto God and men in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</title>
