      <title>Some remarques upon a late popular piece of nonsence called Julian the apostate, &amp;c. together, with a particular vindication of His Royal Highness the Duke of York, by some bold truths in answer to a great many impudent calumnies raised against him, by the foolish arguments, false reasonings and suppositions, imposed upon the publick from several scandalous and seditious pamphlets especially from one more notorious and generally virulent than the rest, sometime since published under the title of A Tory Plot, &amp;c. / by a lover of truth, vertue, and justice.</title>
