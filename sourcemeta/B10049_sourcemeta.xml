         <title>To the musicioners, the harpers, the minstrels, the singers, the dancers, the persecutors; from one who loved dancing and musick as his life, which being parted with, and the light being come, which was before these things, in which they are all seen, and from it is declared, the ground, foundation, beginning, and father, and children, and compass, and end, and the effects of all the harpers, mucisioners [sic], singers and dancers: who may reade what I have learned, who have tryed their wayes, and also searched into the things of God, and declare this according to Scripture, and have found the joy which man cannot take away, in which I rejoyce for ever, because the marriage of the Lamb is come.</title>
