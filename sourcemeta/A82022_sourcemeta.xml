         <title>Spadacrene Anglica, the English spaw, or, The glory of Knaresborough springing from several famous fountains there adjacent, called the vitrioll, sulphurous and dropping wels; and also other minerall waters. Their nature, physical use, situation, and many admirable cures being exactly exprest in the subsequent treatise of the learned Dr. Dean, and the sedulous observations of the ingenious Michael Stanhope Esquire. Wherein it is proved by reason and experience, that the vitrioline fountain is equall (and not inferiour) to the Germain spaw.</title>
