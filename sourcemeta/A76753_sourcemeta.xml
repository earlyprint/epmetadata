         <title>An illumination to open the eyes of the papists (so called) and of all other sects; and to give them to see that whilst they would have liberty of conscience themselves, and yet deny the same liberty to others which themselves would have, they are not for but against liberty of conscience. In the pursuance of which, these questions are laid down and resolved, viz. What conscience is? What religion? What the exercise of religion in the conscience? What the liberty of conscience in the exercise of religion? Wherefore conscience cannot be compelled in the exercise of religion? Together with certain corollaries flowing from thence fit for the information of all such as are yet ignorant what conscience is, or the liberty thereof. / by George Bishope.</title>
