         <title>A practical and short exposition of the catechism of the Church of England by way of question and answer. Wherein the divine authority and reasonableness of every question and answer, every doctrin and practice in it recommended, are evidenced and improved against most contemners of it and dissenters from it. With that moderation and plainness that it may engage all to adhere to, and especially may instruct children in the true Protestant religion of the Church of England. Humbly offered for the good of schools and youth. By Nathanael Taylor, M.A.</title>
