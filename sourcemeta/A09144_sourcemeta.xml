         <note>First part letterpress signatures: A-G&#178; , all in English.

Some copies may have additional letterpress leaves with text in other languages.</note>
         <note>Copies vary in the number of plates in part 1, and plates may have letterpress Latin text on versos. For book 1 originally 41 flower plates (some unnumbered) and one "garden" plate were engraved (the latter with legend "Meridies" at top but other directions not labeled); later 12 plates numbered 43-54 were added. Book 2 originally had 19 plates; later a plate 20 was added, and another copy of the "garden" plate may be present. Book 3 has 26 numbered plates (two numbered 25) plus a "garden" plate with "Meridies" at top and the other three directions also labeled; book 4 has 12 numbered plates and possibly a duplicate of the second "garden" plate.</note>
