      <title>A great and bloudy fight in France: between the Kings army commanded by the Marshal of Thurenne, and the Prince of Conde's forces. With the particulars of the fight; the number killed on both sides, the Prince of Conde's horse being shot under him, and the Duke of Nemours, and many other persons of eminent quality dangerously wounded; and the manner how the Kings forces won their passage over the river Seine, and fell upon their enemies, forcing them to retreat to the city of Paris. Also the rising of the citizens of Paris in a muteny; their drawing the chains, with their firing the town-house, and killing divers of the assembly of the city officers. Likewise, a message sent from the Duke of Lorrain to his brother the Duke of Orleans, concerning his late treaty with the King and court, and his return again into France to assist the Princes.</title>
