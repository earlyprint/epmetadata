      <title>The Parliaments rules and directions concerning sacramentall knowledge contained in an ordinance of the Lords and Commons of the 20th of October 1645. Drawn into questions and answers: (which answers in the bigger character are the ordinance it self in the words of it.) With an addition of Scripture-proofs: and some brief directions for self-examination. By Robert Austin, D.D. For the use of the place where he himself is pastour; and the benefit of such other people, as stand in need of the like help.</title>

      <note>The title page is conjugate with a leaf with signature-mark [sec.] which contains "Rules and directions concerning suspention from the sacrament of the Lords Supper in cases of ignorance", a reprinting of the ordinance. These two leaves possibly were intended to cancel the separate dated title page on A1 which lacks the words "contained in an ordinance .. October 1645.".</note>
      <note>Running title reads: Directions for communicants.</note>
      <note>Annotation on Thomason copy: "Jan: 15 1646"; the 7 in the imprint date has been crossed out.</note>
