      <title>A treatise of the new heavens and new earth. Proved to be perpetual and eternal, in that visible state of both, in the restitution, after the destruction of the world by fire. Whereunto is added, a true state of the thousand years-time; proving it to be before the second coming of Christ. As also, the succinct order of things from Christs first appearing in the clouds, unto the eternal state, after the day of judgment. By T.M. a lover of truth.</title>
