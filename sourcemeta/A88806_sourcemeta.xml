      <title>Laurentius Lutherizans. Or the protestation of George Laurence, Master of Arts, late commoner in Oxford, and late lecturer in the parish-church of George Buttolph-Lane, by Little East-cheap in London. Against certaine calumniations asperged on him by the corrupt clergie, and their lay-proselytes, for some particulars, delivered in two sermons, at Michaels Church in Corne-hill, and else-where, concerning our nationall protestation. As it was declared, by way of digression, in a third sermon at the same church, the 23th. day of Januarie, in the morning lecture, anno, 1642.</title>
