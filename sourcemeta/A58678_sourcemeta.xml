      <title>The cry of the oppressed by reason of false measures: or, A discovery of the true standard-gallon of England what it is, when, and by whom made, and where it ought to be found. By which, the assizes of wine, ale, and corn, are to be justly known, according to the proportions they bear to the standard-gallon. This standard being not known to the commissioners and farmers of the excise of beer, and ale, in London, &amp;c. As appeareth by their non-observances of the assizes of beer and ale, giveth a just accasion of the brewers third grievance complained to the Parliament.</title>
