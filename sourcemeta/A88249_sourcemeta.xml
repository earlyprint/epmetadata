         <title>A salva libertate sent to Colonell Francis West of the Tower of London, on Fryday the fourteenth of September 1649. by Lieutenant Collonell John Lilburne, vnjustly, and illegally imprisoned, in the said Tower, ever since the 28. of March, 1649. Occasioned by the receipt of a verball command (which in law is nothing, nor signefies nothing) whereby the said leiut. was seemingly authorized, to carry the said John Lilburne before Mr. Prideaux the nicknamed, and falsly so called Atturney General on Fryday 14. Sept. 1649.</title>
