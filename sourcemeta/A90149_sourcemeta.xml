      <title>One argument more against the cavaliers; taken from their violation of churches. Where towards the close are subtilly disputed these two questions. 1 Whether the separatist (as he is called) who makes his house (or as it is said) his barn a church, is more scandalous or the cavalier (who looking another way in his discourse and profession) hath yet at Oxford where his Maiestie resides, turned churches (with reverence be it spoken) into prisons, and Iakes, and in Devonshire at many places into stables. 2 Whether churches thus profaned, and fallen from grace, and holinesse, are not by the bishops to be reconsecrated.</title>
