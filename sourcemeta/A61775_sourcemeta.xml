      <title>Strange, dreadful, and amazing news from York. Giving a sad and terrible account of God's fearful judgment on one Winam Tendin, near Rippon in the county of York Who, upon his father's death, perswading his aged tender mother to deliver up her estate and goods to him, upon a slight pretence of quarrel, soon after turned her out of doors a begging, threatning those that should relieve her, so that coming almost starved to his house, when he was making a great feast, he caused the victuals to be set away, and drove her out of his gate: with the words she thereupon uttered. And how his food was turned into fierce poisonous serpents, that stung him to death. And many other circumstances attending so dreadful relaation [sic]. A dreadful relation of a prodigious motion of the earth, near Charleville, in the county of Limerick, in Ireland, on the 7th day of June, 1697. ... sinking hills and raising valleys; and by what means it began and ceased its motion.</title>
