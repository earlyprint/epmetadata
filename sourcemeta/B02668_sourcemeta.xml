      <title>The devils conquest, or, a Wish obtained: Shewing how one late of Barnsby-Street ... carried home some work to her mistris ... who asked her how much shee [sic] owed her for; the maid answered eight pounds; her mistris said 'twas but six ... the maid began to swear and curse, and wisht the Devil fetch her, if there was no eight pounds owing her ... one came and throwed her down ... and suddenly he vanished away ... which caused them to say, it was the Devil ... at midnight she heard a voice ... she swore she would come, and being got out of the bed, fell down upon her face ... her body moving in a most terrible manner ... her mistris was sent for, who freely forgave her, and wisht God might forgive her too ... her body was found as black as pitch all over; and all this was for no more than the value of eleven pence  / ...written for a warning to all, to avoid the like course. The tune is, Summer Time.</title>
