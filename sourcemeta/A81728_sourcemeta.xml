         <title>A plain and faithfull discovery of a beame in Master Edwards his eye. Or A moderate ansvver to the substance of the first and second part of Gangrena. Especially to his prophesie; wherein some of his stories are refuted; the manner of his comming by them questioned. His double dealing detected. Capt. Paul Hobson with some others, vindicated. Mr. Josiah Rycraft examined. Mr. Edwards unparalleld partiality, is impartially declared, and his prophesie truly reflected. / By Edward Drapes.</title>
