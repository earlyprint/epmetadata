         <title>Jehojadahs justice against Mattan, Baals priest: or The covenanters justice against idolaters. A sermon preacht upon occasion of a speech utter'd upon Tower-Hill. Wherein you may finde his likenesse to Mattan rather then to Christ. His place in John 11.48. charg'd upon himself. The weaknesse of the choice of his text. How great cause wee have to give thanks. By J.H. minister of the Gospel.</title>
