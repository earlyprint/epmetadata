      <title>Amygdala Britannica, almonds for parrets. A dish of stone-fruit, partly shel'd and partly unshel'd; which (if crack'd, pick'd and well digested) may be wholesome against those epidemick distempers of the brain, now predominant: and prevent some malignant diseases, likely to ensue. / Composed, heretofore, by a well-knowne moderne author; and, now published according to a copie, found written with his own hand.</title>
