         <title>An appeal to the present rulers in Englands Israel. Touching impious blasphemy against Jesus Christ God the son of late explicitely broached in a scrowl scribled by one William Farmer giving himself the title gent: as also, touching ignorance, and error implicitely, but indeed peremptorily by interrogation a concluding way of argument charged upon the same rulers in his frontispice [sic], or mock-title about a clause conteined in the Apostles Creed, and about the real truth of Jesus Christ. Wherein the appealant modestly, and humbly prayeth the same rulers to vindicate the honour of our blessed Saviour Jesus Christ from horrid impious blasphemy, and their own reputations, and knowledges from calumniation of error, and ignorance. Hereunto is annexed an advertisement to millenaries with a forcible argument framed by our Lord Christs own words against their opinion for his personal reign on earth 1000. years occasioned by the same scriblings of William Farmer. / By Ri. Foster schism. gent.</title>
