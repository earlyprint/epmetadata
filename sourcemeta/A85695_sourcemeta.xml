      <title>Mercurius Cambro-Britannicus. Or, Nevvs from Wales, touching the glorious and miraculous propagation of the Gospel in those parts. Being a clear discovery &amp; manifestation of the late invented trade of tith-gathering there, intended by some persons to be suddenly set on foot and established over all England. Well worthy of the serious and timely consideration of the Parliament, Army and nation, and every individual member thereof.</title>
