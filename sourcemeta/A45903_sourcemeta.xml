      <title>Innocent love in triumph: or, the joys of wedlock made manifest Being a most delightful new play song. No love like that which innocence does crown, On which Hell's daughter Jealousie, can't frown; Nor is it like the smiles that harlots sell, But chast as those who in Elizium dwell; All joys attend it, and all blessings wait, To make fair Celia's long-wish'd joys compleat. To the tune of, The Oxfords bells.</title>
