      <title>A mirror; wherein the rumpers and fanaticks (especially those, who even yet desire to continue religious rebells, and to make piety the sire to treason, and new disturbances;) may see their deformity, and abhor both themselves and their actions. Sent in a letter by a friend, to a votary and follower of that faction. Occasioned by a seditious sermon lately preached.</title>
