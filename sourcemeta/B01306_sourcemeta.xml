         <title>An abstract of the bloody massacre in Ireland. Acted by the instigation of the Jesuits, priests, and friars, who were chief promoters of those horrible murthers; prodigious cruelties, barbarous villanies, and inhumane practices, executed by the Irish Papists upon the English Protestants, in the year 1641. And intended to have been acted over again, on Sabbath Day, December the 9th 1688. But by the wonderful providence of God was prevented.</title>
