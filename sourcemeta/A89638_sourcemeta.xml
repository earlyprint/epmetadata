         <title>A faithful warning, with good advice from Israel's God, to Englands King, and his council that they may wisely improve this little inch of time which the God of their life as yet affords unto them, before the day of their approaching misery come upon them. Which may serve as a caution to all others in authority within the nation. Sounded through one of the mourners in Sion, known by the name of Martin Mason.</title>
