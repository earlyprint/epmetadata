      <note>Alsop and Fawcet printed only the first quire. The text sheets are appropriated from William Typing's "A discourse of eternitie" (STC 24473), printed at Oxford in 1633. Although on [par.]3 recto of the original issue Typing says: "If any man would know the patron of this discourse, let him understand that it belongs to Everybody", it is doubtful if he imagined anyone would take him quite so literally.  Furthermore, the name of Darcie's dedicatee on pi3 recto, William, Lord Maynard, is evidently overprinted or hand-stamped and darkened by pen; should a 2nd copy turn up, one would expect to find a different dedicatee--STC.</note>
