      <title>Medicina magnetica: or, The rare and wonderful art of curing by sympathy: laid open in aphorismes; proved in conclusions; and digested into an easy method drawn from both: wherein the connexion of the causes and effects of these strange operations, are more fully dicovered than heretofore. All cleared and confirmed, by pithy reasons, true experiments, and pleasant relations. / Preserved and published, as a master-piece in this skill. By C. de Iryngio, chirurgo-medcine [sic] in the Army.</title>
