      <title>A most delightful history of the famous clothier of England, called, Jack of Newbery, in the days of King Henry the Eight; how he was beloved of his mistris above all her wealtheir sutors : what great and valiant things he did for England : and the great number of poor he daily cherished.  And how (when the King sent for him) he refused (with his company) to leave the hill of ants to go to the king : and therefore the king went to him which he wittily excused with many other very pleasant passages / written by W.S.</title>
