      <title>Britannia triumphans; or An effectual method wholly to destroy the power of France by encouraging navigation in all its branches. Whereby their Majesties fleet may be sufficiently mann'd in a months time, on any occasion, without impressing; and by making a competent provision for such as shall be wounded in the service of Their Majesties, against the common enemy, in whatsoever stations they are placed. All which may be effected without any very considerable charge to the kingdom. Together with a brief enumeration of the several advantages to be made by erecting a publick fishery, by which a constant nursery of able seamen, and a security and enlargement of our trade abroad will be surely advanced. To which are subjoined, some proposals for the support and maintenance of the children of sll such as fall in the said service; and the certain and best expedient of encreasing the numbers of our privateers. Humbly represented to Their Majesties, and Members of Parliament. By Capt. St. Loe, one of the commissioners of the prize office.</title>
