      <title>Love to the lost: and a hand held forth to the helpless, to lead out of the dark. Wherein is plainly held out divers perticular things, as they are learned of Christ; and are most needfull to be known of all who profess godliness. Set forth chiefly for the directing the simple into the living way of truth, as it is in Christ Jesus, the Righteous, that therein they may come to the life and power of that which the world hath in words; which being received, satisfies the weary soul, and makes the creature wel-pleasing to his maker. Wherein also there is some reproofs to the dark world. / By one that seeks the redemption of Sions seed, and a lover of the creation of God, who is called James Naylor.</title>
