         <title>True newes from Ireland, or, The state of Dublin as it stood the 27 of December, and other parts of Ireland being the copy of a letter sent from a good hand to an alderman of this city shewing that they attempt the blocking up of Dublin and to that end are building two sconces at the havens mouth, out of the command of the castle, upon which they have mounted 12 pieces of ordnance, by reading which you shall find the vanity and falshood of those foolish pamphlets invented and published of late : with a strange and unheard of flocking together of severall kinds of birds over the city of Dublin on Christmas Eve last.</title>
