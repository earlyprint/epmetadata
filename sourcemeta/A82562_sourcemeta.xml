         <title>The last speech, confession &amp; prayer of Joyce Ebbs, to several ministers in the presse-yard at Newgate, and at the place of execution in Smithfield Rounds on Thursday last in the fore-noon. Immediately before she was bound to the stake, to be burnt alive, to ashes, for that horrid act and bloody murdering of her own husband at Dog and Bitch Yard near Drury Lane. : As also, the several passages that happened before her death; her heavie groans and shrieks in the fire, and the providing of a half sheet spread over with pitch, to shorten the time of her miserable torment.</title>
