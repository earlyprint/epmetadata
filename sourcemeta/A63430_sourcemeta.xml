      <title>A true and perfect narrative of the great and dreadful damages susteyned in several parts of England, by the late extraordinary snovvs whereby above twenty families of poor people, men, women, and children, were distressed, and some destroyed at Langsdale, in the bishoprick of Durham: the snow from the hills covering the tops of their houses, that they could not get out: having burnt all their goods to keep them warm. As also of a family in Somerset-shire neer Bath, so beset with the snow, that they were forced to live three days on nothing but grains. And several persons, and great quantities of cattle and sheep lost in Northumberland, Darbyshire, Glocestershire, Shropshire, Lincolnshire, Isle of Ely, and other places. Faithfully extracted from letters lately sent form persons of good credit and quality in all those parts.</title>
