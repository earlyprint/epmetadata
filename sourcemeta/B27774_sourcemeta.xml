         <title>Two strings to a bow; or, The cunning archer being a pleasant new ditty of a souldier, that had two lasses at one time that dearly loved him, and how he requited their kindness this lusty souldier having been ten years in Scotland, and near seen a London lass, resolv'd to try, how much they priz'd virginity. He laies close siege to two, and stormes there forts, but yet to marry scorns. To an excellent Scotish tune, call'd Gilderoy.</title>
