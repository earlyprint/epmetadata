      <title>A table to all the epistles and gospels in the Book of Common Prayer So that you may find any of them, when named by the minister, though you know not what Sunday it is. And also what texts of scripture are quoted, being contained in them. To be found in an alphabetical manner. This table may put in your Common Prayer book, without new binding, being so small a thing.</title>
