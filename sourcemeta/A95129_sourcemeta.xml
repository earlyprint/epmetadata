      <title>The true portraiture of a prodigious monster, taken in the mountains of Zardana the following description whereof was sent to Madrid, Octob. 20. 1654. and from thence to Don Olonz de Cardines, ambassador for the King of Spain, now resident at London. Its stature was like that of a strong well set man, with 7 head, the chief of them looking forward, with one eye in its sion; the other heads have each two eyes in their natural situation, the ears of an ass; with its principal head it eates, drinks, and cryes with an extraordinary and terrible voyce; the other heads are also moved to and fro: it hath seven arms and hands of a man, very strong in each of the: from the middle downward it is like a satyr, with goats fee, and cloven; it hath no distinction of sex. To the tune of, Summer time.</title>
