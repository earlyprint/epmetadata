      <title>A defiance against all arbitrary usurpations or encroachments, either of the House of Lords, or any other, upon the soveraignty of the supreme House of Commons, (the high court of judicature of the land) or upon the rights, properties and freedoms of the people in generall. Whereunto is annexed, a relation of the unjust and barbarous proceedings of the House of Lords, against that worthy commoner, Mr. Overton, who standeth by them committed to the most contemptuous goal of Newgate, for refusing to answer to interrogatories, and appealing from that court to the Honourable House of Commons (as by the great Charter of England he was bound) for the triall of his cause. Howsoever the House of Lords do suggest in their commitment of him, that it was for his contemptuous words and gesture, refusing to answer unto their speaker. Which being every mans case, is published ... as it was enclosed in a letter to one of his friends.</title>
