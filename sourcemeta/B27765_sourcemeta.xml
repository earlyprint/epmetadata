      <title>A word of exhortation to our separating brethren of whatever denomination, especially those commonly called Anabaptists beseeching them to stirre up their hearts to an upright impartiall, and unbended considering of their wayes, in order to their giving glory to truth and peace, and to taking hold of the strengths of God, in this day of our own weakness. The chief points, these four; 1. Twenty particulars, wherein our brethren seem to have receded from Christ crucified, or the Gospel. 2. Active obedience to authority, in things, by God neither commanded nor forbidden; whether a Gospel duty? 3. Infant baptisme, seeming to goe upon most short and clear grounds of Holy Scripture and sanctified reason. 4. Known set formes of prayer, whether an help to devotion in congregations and families, much more proper and effectuall, then prayer by the gift?</title>
