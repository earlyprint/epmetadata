         <title>A pleasant spelling-piece spelling the most variously written syllables in the Bible, or elsewhere, with such distinction, plain and delightful demonstrations, that the least reading child may quickly become perfect in spelling. VVith such an introduction into the Latine-tongue, as renders that whole tongue attainable with far less charge to memory, than the very grammar-rules hitherto have been. To this sweet method let us all apply, leav't not to Rome, Spain, France, or Germany: VVho ne'r well yet distinguish'd th' grounds of speech, Let us them teach, not they us I beseech.</title>
