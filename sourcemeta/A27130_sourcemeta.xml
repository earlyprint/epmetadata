      <title>Iacob is become a flame and the house of Esav stubble, or, The battail betwixt Michael and the dragon in which the seed of the woman is bruising the serpents head, and Cain the first birth ... is found the vagabond, and Abel and Abraham ... the friends of God : being a true discovery of the two seeds or births between which the enmity is put, the time and day being come in which the elder must serve the younger : with a few words to the priests, Bishops, Episcopal-men, and professors of this last age, and a short warning to the rulars and inhabitants of the earth.</title>
