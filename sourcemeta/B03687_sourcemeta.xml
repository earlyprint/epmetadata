         <title>An appeal to the impartial &amp; judicious reader. Touching the points in debate between the author and Mr. Joseph Hacon; and their debates in those points. Or, A detection of the weakness, wriness [sic], and many miscarriages of the said Mr. Hacon, in his late vindication of his review. To which is added in the close, a brief declaration of the grace of God to mankind and a serious invitation to all men to embrace it. / By John Horne, minister of South-Lin in Norfolk.</title>
