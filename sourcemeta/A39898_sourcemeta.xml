      <note>Generally believed to have been originally written by Dekker, perhaps his unpublished "Phaeton," revised, with additions, by Ford, to whom the last two acts may be assigned. Cf. Camb. History of Eng. lit.; DNB.</note>
      <note>According to Greg's List of plays (p. 38) and the collation in the Catalogue of the library of F. Locker-Lampson (p. 45) the dedication differs from that in the edition of 1657, but that given in Pearson's reprint, 1873, is the same as that in the L.C. copy of 1657: "To the Right Honorable Thomas Wriathesley, Earle of Southampton." The Locker-Lampson copy contains a dedication to "Algernowne Percy, Earl of Northumberland."</note>
