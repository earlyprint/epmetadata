         <title>Gods ordinance, the saints priviledge. Discovered and proved in two treatises. The first, the saints interest by Christ in all the priviledges of grace: wherein their right to the use of baptisme, and the Lords supper, even now during the reign of Antichrist, is cleared; and the objections of those that oppose the same, are answered. The second, the peculiar interest of the elect in Christ, and his saving grace: wherein it is proved that Christ hath not presented to his fathers justice a satisfaction for the sinnes of all men; but onely for the sinnes of those that doe, or shall believe in him; which are his elect onely: and the objections of those that maintaine the contrary, are also answered. / Both written by John Spilsberie. And the last transcribed, and somewhat enlarged, by Benjamin Coxe. Licensed, entred, and printed according to order.</title>
