         <note>Although "A blast from the Lord" (Wing N1104, with separate pagination and register) is called for on the title page, and the imprints seem to be in the same setting, most copies lack it. Thomason dated his copy of each item, though he received them on the same day. ESTC catalogues it separately.</note>
         <note>Annotation on Thomason copy: "March. 12".</note>
