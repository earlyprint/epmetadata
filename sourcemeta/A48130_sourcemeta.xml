      <title>A letter sent by an Oxford scholler to his quondam schoolemaster wherein the Parliament is proved either not to be at all, or to be at Oxford : their pretences detected, some objections answered, and the Kings cause so asserted, that the schoolmasters answer doth acknowledge himselfe convinc't : as also the scholler's reply to that answer, wherein he hath inserted a love-elegie from one of the five members to his paramour and his repulse in her answer.</title>
