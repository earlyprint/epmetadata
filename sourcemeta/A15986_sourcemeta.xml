         <note>A paraphrase in verse of Proverbs and certain psalms that is falsely attributed to Thomas Sternhold. The misattribution is corrected in "Certayn chapters taken out of the Proverbes of Salomon" (STC 12631), in which the paraphrase of Proverbs is identical. The paraphrases of Ecclesiastes i-iii and at least Psalm lxxxviii (E1r-F2v) are by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. Two of the other minor poems are also printed in 12631.3, another edition of STC 12631--Cf. STC.</note>
