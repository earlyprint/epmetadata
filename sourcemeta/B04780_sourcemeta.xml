      <title>Poor Tom the taylor his lamentation. Giving and account how he pickt up a miss near the Maypole in the Strand, and also how he handed her to the fair. where [sic] he treated her very generously, but according to the old proverb, sweet meat must have sower sauce, for while he was safe a snoring in bed she very dexterously picked his pocket, leaving him to pay the reckoning, without ever a penny in his purse, this unfortunate disaster may well be a warning to all the taylors in or about London to forsake their old accustomed tricks, setting poor Tom before them as an example. To the tune of, Daniel Cooper.</title>
