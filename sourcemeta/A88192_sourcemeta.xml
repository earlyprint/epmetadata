      <title>An hue-and cry after the fundamental lawes and liberties of England occasionally written upon the stealing of one of the grand assertors of them out of Newgate, by a party of men on horseback, pretending themselves to be souldiers, raised and paid by the people of England (not for the subversion,) but the preservation of the said lawes and liberties, &amp;c. Together with some queries, and brief resolves, touching the present state of things, written for the consolation of the saints now reigning. By a well-wisher to the saints now reigning on earth, had they had the patience to have staid till the people had chose them, or that Christ the King of Saints above --- had setled the government upon them.</title>
