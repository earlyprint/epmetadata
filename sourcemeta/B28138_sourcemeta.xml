      <title>A plain and easie way to reduce guineas, which now is the only passable coin for payments, in such method that neither the king nor any of his subjects will lay under the least disadvantage; but by so doing, will produce a speedy supply to his Majesty and all his revenues, and thereby all the nobility and gentry of England will have their revenues will [sic] paid; which will encourage trade, and quicken payment to merchants and tradesmen, and by the means following will bring back guineas out of foreign countries, and make them plentiful here: and likewise a method for setling of the silver coin in this nation, during the time of reducing guineas. Humbly presented to the consideration of both Houses in Parliament.</title>
