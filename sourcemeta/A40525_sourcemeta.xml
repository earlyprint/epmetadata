         <title>A visitation by way of declaration unto the manifestation of the spirit in you rulers and heads of these nations both Parliaments, officers, and souldiers, that are in arms and authority to do service for the Common-Wealth outwardly. Amongst whom I formerly have had my conversation about thirteen or fourteen years, and with many of them I have often engaged against the enemies of the peace and liberties of the honest people of these nations, and that some of the old officers and souldiers may very well remember. From a true lover of your souls, that loves to do justice, and all that join with them, known unto the children of men by this name, Joseph Fuce.</title>
