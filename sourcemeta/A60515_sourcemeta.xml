      <title>The foundation of preaching asserted In opposition to a counterfeit sermon pretended to be preached before the people called Quakers, in the park, Southwark, 27th of 9th 1687. That all those that feign themselves ministers of the Gospel dispensation, may see that all preaching without the Holy Spirit, and a real call by the grace of God, working in their hearts, and immediately leading them thereto; is nothing but the meer notion of their own brains, and not for the advancement of pure religion.
