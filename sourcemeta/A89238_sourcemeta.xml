Together with the manner how my Lord of Canterbury would put and keep them in the ministery, notwithstanding the many petitions and certificates from their parishioners, and others, presented to him, they being the head and most notorious of the scandalous ministers within the county of Suffolke, and well may be said of all England. And against whom as chiefe of the scandalous ministers the county of Suffolke have petitioned to the Parliament: and desired to bee seene by Parliament, because herein is something mentioned, which is conceived, that one of these scandalous ministers have abused the authority of the Lords in Parliament.</title>
