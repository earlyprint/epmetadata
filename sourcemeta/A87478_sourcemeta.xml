         <title>The resurrection of dead bones, or, The conversion of the Jewes. In a treatise, wherein are clearly demonstrated the places where, and manner how the ten supposed lost Tribes of Israel do at this day subsist. With a description of the future glorious estate of the Twelve, at the incomparable union of Judah and Ephraim; which must shortly be in reference to its compleating the whole mysterie of mans redemption, and real establishing of the kingdom of Jesus Christ, after the Jews conversion. / Written by J.J. Philo-Jud&#230;us.</title>
