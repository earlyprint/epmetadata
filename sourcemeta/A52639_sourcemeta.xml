         <title>A narrative of the late extraordinary cure wrought in an instant upon Mrs. Eliz. Savage (lame from her birth) without the using of any natural means with the affidavits which were made before the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor, and the certificates of several credible persons, who knew her both before and since her cure : enquired into with all its circumstances, by noted divines, both of the Church of England, and others, and by eminent physicians of the College, and many persons of quality, who have express'd their full satisfaction : with an appendix, attempting to prove, that miracles are not ceas'd.</title>
