         <title>The vveepers: or, the bed of snakes broken. Wit vitiated, and made a pander to wickednesse; instanced in a pack of knaves (calling themselves servants to the late King) worthy the anger of the present age; and the wonder and indignation of all posterity. Six cupping-glasses, clapt to the cloven feet of the six d&#230;mons, who govern the times by turns from Munday to Saturday annually. / By S.S.</title>
