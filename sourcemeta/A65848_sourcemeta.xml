      <title>The case of the suffering people of God truly stated and their innocencie vindicated from the false aspersions and pretences (under which the persecution spirit seeks to cover it self, to make the nation believe its proceedings against them are just) that it may be unvailed, and appear as it is in its self, and the cause for which Gods people suffer made appear, according to the nature of it : wherein also the persecutors in England are warned, before the day of the Lord overtake them, as a destruction from him.</title>
