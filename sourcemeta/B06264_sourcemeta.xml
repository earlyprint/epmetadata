Where nine persons (six men and three women) were condemn'd to die. With a particular relation of the young man at Enfield, and his brother and sister's tryal and condemnation, who most barbarously abused his sweetheart by cutting off one of her lips, putting out one of her eyes, slashing her cheeks, stabbing her in several places, and other inhumane cruelties. To which is added, a true account of the bloody murther in the Hay-market, where a coachman lately kill'd his wife with a fire-fork. As also an account how many are burn'd in the hand, transported, and to be whipt.</title>
