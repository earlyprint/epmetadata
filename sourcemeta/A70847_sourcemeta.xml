      <title>[Hebrew] or, A (pretended) visitor visited for not visiting according to his bounden duty required by ancient and modern canons. In which is discover'd, how much iniquity abounds, by reason of his shameful, if not wilful neglect: at least how little care he hath taken to suppress it, by punishing or admonishing the guilty. Written by a friend to plain-dealing.</title>
