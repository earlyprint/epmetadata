      <title>Trust a papist and trust the Devill, or, no vvit to a womans: a reall relation of a romish priest, who to obtain his desire upon a married wife, not far from Yorke, would fain have perswaded her, that adultery was but a veniall sin, with a copy of a letter from the recusant to the woman, also her answer to it, and she revealing it to her husband. Also the manner how the husband with some of his neighbours did use this priest comming to tempt his wife in their owne house, first they whipt him about the chamber, and afterward gelded him, as a most just recompence for his lasciviousnesse. As also, how a witty maid served a romish Catholique about the like matter, making him to fall into a river, where he scarce escaped drowning.</title>
