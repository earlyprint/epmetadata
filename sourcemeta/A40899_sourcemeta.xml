      <title>The Lord Cravens case stated; and the impostor dethron'd by way of reply to Captain George Bishop, a grand Quaker in Bristoll. Wherein is briefly hinted, the rottenness of the Quakers conversion, and perfection, in general, exemplified in this busie bishop; in special instanced in his practises against the estate of the Lord Craven, life of Mr. Love. By occasion whereof, this truth is asserted, viz. if we may judge of the conscience, honesty, and perfection of Quakers in general, by this man in particular, a man may be as vile a person, as any under heaven, and yet a perfect Quaker.</title>
