         <title>A famous city turned into stone. Or, A fearfull example for England to take warning by: in which is contained all the full and whole description of a famous city in Barbary, that was for their rebellion against God (in the twinkling of an eye) both men, women, and children, with all the cattle, houses, and materials therein turned to stone. The manner how shall in this little booke be faithfully and truely related according to very good authors, which have since this great and miraculous wonder happened, been at the place where it was done, and have seene (with much teror) those things which shall be presantly spoken of. / Writen by Laurence Price.</title>
