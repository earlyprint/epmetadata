         <title>A declaration and remonstrance of the present engagement of the kingdome of Scotland. With their resolutions and intentions (according to their late solemne League and Covenant) to establish the Presbyterian government in the church, to redeeme his Majesty from the hands of schismatickes, and place him in his Parliament, with honour and safety, to procure the peace of the three kingdoms, to vindicate the worthy members of Parliament, falsely impeached by the army, with the true priviledges of Parliament, and liberty of the subject. All which are not onely indangered, but by likelyhood ready to be destroyed, by the power of an over-awing tyrannicall army, under the conduct of Sir Thomas Fairfax.</title>
