         <title>Advertisement by the sheriff deput of Aberdeen-shire undersubscryving in relation to the Lords of Councill their Proclamation against forstallers, and allowing importation of victuall. Whereas, I have received the said Proclamation of date the ninth day of Iune instant, and that the famen is of great import to be known generally to all in the countrey, there being few who may not be concerned therein; therefore I am advysed, and it is thought fit to cause re-print the same, to be read at each parish kirk within this shire, and whereof the tenor followes, Proclamation against regraiting of victual, and forestallers, and allowing the importation of victual free of publick burden.</title>
