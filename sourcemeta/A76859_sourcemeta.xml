And then went home together, and being in their lodging, demanded of her the money she had taken that day, but she (being great with child and peevish) refused to give it him, he taking his butchers-knife in his hand stabb'd her in the back, whereof she instantly dyed, for which he was apprehended, condemned, and executed at Tyburn, April the 24th. 1667. : As also another relation of a ravisher, who in a bawdy-house (assisted by two women) ravished a girle. : The tune, The bleeding heart.</title>
