      <title>A candle for the blinde citizens of London, to see by: by a freeman of the same city, though of neither ranke or quality, yet reall in heart, fearing God, honouring his King, and a lover of truth, peace, and the brotherhood. With Englands farewell from its ancient prosperity, to its new change of misery.</title>
