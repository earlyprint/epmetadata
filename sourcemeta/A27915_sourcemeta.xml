      <title>The psalter, or, Psalms of David paraphras'd in verse set to new tunes and so design'd that by two tunes onely the whole number of psalms (four onely excepted) may be sung, one of which tunes is already known (being the usual tune of the C. psalm) : the other tunes onely are new, but any one of them being learnt all the other psalms may be sung by that one onely tune : as on the contrary any one psalm may be sung by all the new tunes, so that a greater facility for those who are less able to sing, or a greater variety for those who are more able, cannot reasonably be desired or afforded / by Richard Goodridge.</title>
