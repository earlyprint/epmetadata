         <title>A vvord to the people of the world, who hates the light, to be witnessed by the light in them all; wherein is shewed unto them, what the light is, which is the condemnation of the world with its deeds, and what the spirit of truth is, and what it leads them unto, who are led by it; and what the spirit of errour is, and what it leads them into, who are lead by it; and also they are here exhorted to repent whiles they have the light, to believe and walk in the light, least darkness come upon them, and they into it be cast, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Also a few queries to such professors as stumbles at the light, the word, the kingdom, and spirit of God within, and tell people that none can be free from sin in this life, and yet say that they own the scriptures.</title>
