      <note>Attributed to Increase Mather.  Cf. NUC pre-1956.</note>
      <note>What is evidently a first draft of the above, containing about one-half of the text, is among the Hutchinson papers in possession of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and was printed in its collections, 3rd ser., v. 1, p. 93-101; the handwriting is not that of Mather.</note>
      <note>The "Brief relation" includes in addition the 12th article of the Declaration of the gentlemen, merchants, and inhabitants of Boston, Apr. 18, 1689 (believed to have been written by Mather); Abraham Kick's letter to the Princess of Orange, Feb. 1, 1689 n.s.; and a translation of Mather's "De successu Evangelij apud Indos in Nova-Anglia epistola. Ad ... Johannem Leusaenum."  It was reprinted in Force's Tracts, v. 4, no. 11, and Andros tracts, v. 2, p. 147-170, the latter containing a discussion of authorship.</note>
