         <title>Ecchoes from the sixth trumpet. The first part reverberated by a review of neglected remembrances, abreviating [sic] precautions and predictions heretofore published at several times, upon sundry occasions, to forewarn what the future effects of divine justice would be, as soon as our sinnes were full ripe,if not prevented by timely repentance : most part of the predictions have been already seen or heard verified, both by the author yet living, and by many others, who observed at what times, in what manner, upon what persons, and in what places they were literally or mystically fulfilled : collected out of the said authors printed books, who conscienciously [sic] observed on what divine prophesies the said predictions were grounded, as also God's late frequent intermixture of judgments and mercies, to reclaim this generation.</title>
