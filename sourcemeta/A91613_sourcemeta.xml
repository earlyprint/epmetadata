         <title>The Quakers terrible vision; or, The devils's progress to the City of London: being a more true and perfect relation of their several meetings, transes, quakings, shakings, roarings, and trembling postures; the appearing of two strange oracles, with an old love-lock cut off from Satans head; the manner of putting it in practice, and drawing in of others; the burning of their fine cloaths, points, and ribbons, which seemed to them like so many hellish hags, and ...; their several opinions and tenets, holding a community with all mens wives, either sleeping or waking; their strange doctrine, raptures, and inspirations; and the most hideous actions of all the several sorts of Quakers; as Catharists, Familists, Enthusiasts, Mentanists, Valencians, &amp; Libertins, the liike [sic] never read, or heard of before, since the memory of man.</title>
