         <note>This work is in part supplementary to the English ed. of Exquemelin's Bucaniers of America, 1684, and in part a vindication of the English, especially Capt. Henry Morgan, from the aspersions of that writer. "The adventures of Capt. Barth. Sharp and others in the South Sea" (p. 1-114) differs from both Basil Ringrose's account, published in "Bucaniers of America, the second volume, containing the dangerous voyage ... of Captain Bartholomew Sharp," 1685, and Sharpe's own journal as printed in William Hack's Collection of original voyages, 1699.</note>
