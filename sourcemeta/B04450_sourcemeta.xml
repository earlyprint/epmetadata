         <title>The maltster caught in a trap or, The witty ale-wife. This ale-wife she was run upon the maltster's score full twenty-pounds for malt, I think, and more: but he desir'd a bit of Venus game, and I think he paid  full dearly for the same: he made a discharge I say for once, and glad he was that he could save his stones: he was lamfateed [sic] till his bones were sore; he has made a vow he'l ne'r come there no more; the ale-wifes husband did so belabour him, that made him stink, and piss for very shame. Tune is, What should a young woman do with an old man: or, Digby's farewel.</title>
