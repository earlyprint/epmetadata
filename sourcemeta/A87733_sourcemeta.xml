         <title>Every man's duty, and the godly man's practice, or, Exhortations to love God drawn from the consideration of his great goodness towards us, and the many mercies, favours, and benefits, which we daily receive at his hands, which may stir up every one to the greatest measure of thankfulness, and perswade us all to live unto Gods glory : very profitable for these times wherein iniquity doth abound, and the love of many waketh cold.</title>
