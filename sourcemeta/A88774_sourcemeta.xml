      <title>The latest remarkable truths from Worcester, Chester, Salop, Warwick, Stafford, Somerset, Devon, Yorke, and Lincoln counties. Most of which was sent up poste from judicious men, of purpose to be printed. Among other things there is a cruell and bloody speech of the Lord Paulets, which he spake to his fellow souldiers in Sherbourne the 7. of September, wherein he gives them order to kill men, women, and children, without mercie, but to reserve such ministers as they could take that were well-wishers to the Parliament, for to be flead alive, and such like exquisite torments.</title>
