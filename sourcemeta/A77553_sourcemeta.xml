      <title>The power of God overpowering the creature. Which power came upon me William Britten, the 3d. day of the 11th. month, (called February) 1659. not suffering me to depart my chamber, until I had promised the Lord to answer a book, which I had then never seen, and but once heard of; set forth by William Prynne in defence of tyths, &amp;c. and to present the answer in print unto the governing power of England for the time being. But making delayes, and Fran. Spira-like, consulting with flesh and blood, the Lord terrified me in conscience for neglect, yet in mercy did set me (like Jonah) the second time upon the same work.</title>
