         <title>Eye-salve for the English armie, and their assistants. Or, a breviate of several particulars seriously to be considered by all those that either are, or have been engaged in the late war against King single person or Lords spirituall and temporall, that are not willing to yield their necks to the rope or block. With a letter sent from several regiments of horse and foot in the army, to the rest of their fellow souldiers now in arms in the several garrisons of England, Scotland and Ireland, plainly discovering the great danger that is like to fall upon them, after the so long hazarding their lives, if not timely prevented.</title>
