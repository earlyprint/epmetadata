         <title>The picture of Mercurius Politicus: or Some of his falsities and mistakes, mentioned in his intelligence of the twelfth of October, concerning the dispute in Lumbardstreet, detected and disproved. Wherein the carriage of the people resort-in to the meeting-place there, upon the said day, and other times, is cleared: to the satisfaction of those that will not censure before they understand, nor give up their judgments to trust vanity and lyes.
