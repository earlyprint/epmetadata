      <title>The nations claim of native right Wherein the gross and extreme defection and injustice of the court martial, and of all courts; the destructive abuse of the law, and pressing necessity, that the nation speedily unite (as one man) for an agreement in righteousness, is by particular example, and an appeal to the general councel of the army, and by several considerations cleerly demonstrated and proved. Secondly, the nullity of order, matter, and form of a free people is asserted, and proved by scripture: and how (to persons, families, people, and churches) right order, matter, and form may be attained. Thirdly, a brief pourtraict of a right government of the nation, and agreement of the people; and how such government and agreement may be with ease attained; a new representative freely elected: the laws rectified: the poor relieved: and the peoples, and armies, and every particular persons just interests (in peace with truth) satisfied, is proposed to the nation.
