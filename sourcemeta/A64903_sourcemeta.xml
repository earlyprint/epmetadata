      <title>True information of the beginning and cause of all our troubles how they have been hatched, and how prevented. Wherein vvee may see the manifold contrivances and attempts of forraigne and home-bred enemies, against the Parliament, kingdome, and purity of religion. And how all their endeavours whether by force or fraud, never prospered. A work worthy to be kept in record, and to bee communicated to posterity.</title>
