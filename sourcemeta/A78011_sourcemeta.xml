      <title>An appeal from Chancery, to the Lord General and his Councel of Officers, as also to the Councel of State, and to all free-born English men of honest hearts, who have not forfeited their liberty, or captivated their reason, but fear and love the name of God, and the interest of all honest men, ... that Christs kingdom may be advanced, and the kingdom of Satan, with Antichrist, and that of the beast, may be thrown down, with all their covetous, persecuting, ... perjured officers, ..., either that have been corrupt Parliament-men, ... such who are in places of judicature, ... with every corrupt member thereof, ...in England, or in places called Innes of Court, or the devil's school of sophisticating and lying, frauds and hypocrisies, which bring forth a generation of vipers, ... wolves in sheeps clothing, ... or those in places of government in cities, ... who usurp authority over English-men, and that because they are in place or places over them, they combine also with this serpentine brood, and tyrannize over their brethren which never yet brake their trust, as the most of these have done, and that because they will not sacrifice to this devil of unrighteousness, ... to do unrighteously, and to deceive, and defraud, and oppress their brethren, and to undo them, as these experimentally many of them are found and known to do, for filthy lucre sake.</title>
