         <title>Prelimited forms of praising God, vocally sung by all the church together, proved to be no gospel ordinance. In a sober discourse concerning singing. With a large appendix thereunto added, containing several things not treated of before; and wherein the case of singing is more fully opened and discussed in divers principal branches of it: greatly tending to the clearing and confirmation of the truth discoursed of in the former part. / By Isaac Marlow.</title>
