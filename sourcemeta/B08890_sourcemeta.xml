         <title>A funeral elegy humbly dedicated to the renowned memory of the honourable, Thomas Danforth Esq. of Cambridge, sometimes deputy governour in the colony of the Massachusetts-Bay, and president of the province of main; and one of His Majesties honourable council.  Judge of the superiour court in the providence of the Massachusetts-Bay in New England; who (after he had long served his generation by the will of God in several high stations) did to our inconceivable loss, but his unparallel'd gain, rest from all his labours, on the sacred day of rest, the memorable 5th of November : Anno Domini. 1699.</title>
