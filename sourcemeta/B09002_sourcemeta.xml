         <title>The inclosing of Jarrowslike and making ballast-shores on it, will greatly advantage the river Tyne and all ships trading to that port and be no real damage to any unless it be so, to some perticular ballast-wharfs already made on the river in places not so fit for that use as this will be when tis done : the preservation of the river, or what may any way damage the trade of Newcastle in general, being intended to be provided for in the bill.</title>
