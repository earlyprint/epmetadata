Occasioned by laying open some deceipts in a booke titled, The deceiv'd and deceiving Quakers discovered; subscribed Mathew Caffin and William Jeffery, brethren in iniquitie, who are joyned to deny God, Christ, the light, and spirit, in his saints, and calls it teaching Christs spirit apart from his body, and an evill spirit, to witnesse the spirit of Christ in the saints. Set forth that the simple may see the wiles the devill hath to keepe them from the word of life, the soules salvation. / By a lover of Israels seede, called James Nayler.</title>
