         <title>Here followeth a true relation or some of the sufferings inflicted upon the servrnts [sic] of the Lord, who are called Quakers by this generation of evil-doers as will appear by the fruits of the schollars and proctors of the University of Oxford, who from the very first appearance of the Lord amongst his people in Oxford, until this time, hath manifested their fruits, and of what stock and generation they are, which fruits now are laid open, that all may see their wickednesse, and may depart from them and their evil works, least they partake of their judgements.</title>
