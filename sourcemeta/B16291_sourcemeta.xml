         <title>The Christian synagogue Wherein is contayned the diverse reading, the right poynting, translation, and collation of scripture with scripture. With the customes of the Hebrewes and proselytes, and of all those nations, with whom they were conversant. Digested into three bookes. The first, shewing the meanes both inward and outward, to attaine to the knowledge of the sense of the whole Scripture. The second, vnfolding the true sense of the Scripture it selfe ... The third, teaching the true manner of confirmation, illustration, and application of doctrines ... Serving generally for a helpe to the vnderstanding, of all; that desire to know and obey the will of God in holy Writ: but more specially for all young students in divinitie, that they may more easily vnderstand the languages of Canaan, and Greece, and make a profitable vse of them in preaching. By Iohn Weemse of Lathoquar, in Scotland, preacher of Christs Gospell.</title>
