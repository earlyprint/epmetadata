         <title>Love to the captives: or, The love of God to the world; who so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten son, to be the light of the world, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life, and no man cometh to the father, but by him, (who is the redeemer of the captives.) Given forth for their sakes, who desire to turn to the Lord, or to see a return out of captivity, declaring the way to God, and where power against sin may be received, that your souls may no longer be held under the snare of the Divel, nor you be made a prey upon by deceivers, but come away to the light, which is the power of God unto salvation; and he that believes shall be saved, and he that believes not shall be damned.</title>
