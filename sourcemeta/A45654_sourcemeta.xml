      <title>A brief discourse of mans estate in the first and second Adam Shewing these six points, I Man had a glorious beginning. II Man is much varied from himself. III Mans sin was caused by himself. IV Mans misery followes his non-dependence on God. V Man once off from God, and left to himself wanders irrecoverably.
