         <title>A lamentacion (by one of Englands prophets) over the ruines of this oppressed nacion, to be deeply layd to heart by Parliament and Army, and all sorts of peeple, lest they be swept away with the besom of destruction, in the day of the Lords fierce wrath and indignation, which is near at hand. Written by the movings of the Lord in James Nayler. And a vvarning to the rulers of England not to usurp dominion over the conscience, nor to give forth lawes contrary to that in the conscience.
