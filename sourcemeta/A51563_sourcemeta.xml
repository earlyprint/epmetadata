      <note>The first part, entitled, "An argument shewing, that a standing army is inconsistent with a free government," was written by John Trenchard and Walter Moyle.  It is often thought Trenchard also assisted in the second part; however attributed solely to Moyle by BM, Wing, and Halkett and Laing.</note>
