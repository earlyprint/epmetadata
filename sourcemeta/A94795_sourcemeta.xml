      <title>Strange and wonderful nevves from VVhite-Hall: or, The mighty visions proceeding from Mistris Anna Trapnel, to divers collonels, ladies, and gentlewomen, concerning the government of the commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland; and her revelations touching his Highness, the Lord Protector, and the army. With her declaration touching the state-affairs of Great-Brittain; even from the death of the late King Charles, to the dissolution of the last Parliament. And the manner how she lay eleven dayes, and twelve nights in a trance, without taking any sustenance, except a cup of small beer once in 24 hours: during which time, she uttered many things herein mentioned, relating to the governors, churches, ministry, universities, and all the three nations; full of wonder and admiration, for all that shall read and peruse the same.</title>
