      <note>Attributed by BM and Surgeon General's catalogues to John Pechey (under which heading they include the works of John Pechey, 1655-1716, and also those of John Peachie, the extra licentiate). This pamphlet is not included among the works of Pechey listed in DNB. It is attributed by Halkett and Laing, 1926, to "John Peachie or Pechey, M.D." (presumably the extra-licentiate). This attribution is probably wrong, since John Peachie was not admitted an extra-licentiate of the College of Physicians until 1683.</note>
