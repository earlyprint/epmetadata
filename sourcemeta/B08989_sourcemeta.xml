         <title>A true and strange relation of the travels, adventures, and great persecution of four eminent Quakers who in the year 1680 travelled through France, Italy and Turkey, to promote their religion. Wherein is fully declared the designs, endeavours and attempts of these zealous Quakers, for the conversion of the great Turk and the pope. With a perfect account of the event and success of the business, and of all the most remarkable passages. Also a faithful relation of their private discourses and disputes which passed between these Quakers and the pope, the cardinal his cousin, and Cardinal Pool. Also of their voyage to Constantinople, and of their most barbarous cruel and bloody death by the special command of the chief governour the great Turk. Who caused their hands to be chop'd off, their tongues to be cut out, and their eyes bored out, and each man to have a wooden stake run in at his fundament quite through his body. / Faithfully and compendiously related by John Elias Esq; who was an eye-witness to a great part of these transactions in Constantinople.</title>
