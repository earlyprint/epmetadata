      <note>In 1621? Butter and Stansby were punished for printing this; see Greg, Companion pp. 209-211; the documents are undated and possibly miscalandared in Cal. S.P.D. since the punishemnts seem to have occurred in early 1621; the proclamation referred to by Stansby may be STC 8649. F.S. Ferguson identified other pamphlets on the Bohemian question from the same press, which he thought might be that of W. Jones: STC 3210, 3214, 3215, 10810, 11350, 11351, 11356; 11349 may belong in this group also--STC.</note>
