         <title>The husband's authority unvail'd; wherein it is moderately discussed whether it be fit or lawfull for a good man, to beat his bad wife. Some mysteries of iniquity are likewise unmasked, and a little unfolded. A subject, to some, perhaps, as unwelcom as uncoth. / From an inner cloyster of the Temple; by Moses &#224; Vauts a faithfull votary, and free denizen of the Common-wealth of Israel.</title>
