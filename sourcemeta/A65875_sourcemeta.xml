         <title>No remission without repentance nor will a bare confession withovt a real forsaking of sin avail to the averting God's heavy visitation and judgments from this nation of England, the cause whereof being somewhat more fully declared herein then is confessed in the fast which was appointed for the averting of the same heavy visitation and this concerns both the rulers, clergy, and people of London and Westminster and all parts of this realm to look into and lay to heart who are concerned in the observation of the said fast to consider what fruits they bring forth and whether the end of the true fast be answered by them yea or nea, according to Isa. 58.</title>
