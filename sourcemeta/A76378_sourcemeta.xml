         <title>Logoi apologetikoi. Foure apologicall tracts exhibited to the supreme, self-made authority, now erected in, under the Commons name of England. Wherein is proved, that their unparallel'd acts in beheading the most Christian King, nulling the regall office, disclaiming the knowne heire, Charles the II. and declaring it treason to refell their errours, are diametrically opposite to the Scriptures, the greatest opprobrie to Christianity that ever was in the world; and, without true repentance, will either make England not Christian, or no English nation. / By T.B. a conscientious and orthodox divine.</title>
