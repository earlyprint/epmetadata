      <title>Gods revenge upon his Parliaments and peoples enemies, by the examples of some great malignants, whom God hath punished to give others warning. Being a true relation of foure citizens of London dwelling on Ludgate-hill, that went to Oxford, and with others as ill affected as themselves, drank healths to the confusion of the Parliament, as they came home, one of them broke his leg, another broke his backe, and the other two fell mad, all remaining in a miserable condition: together with the like example of the Lord Hopton at Madbury neere Plymouth, and one M. Turner vintner at the Halfe Moone at Oxford. Also the discovery of a bloudy plot against the City of London.</title>
