      <title>A tender salutation of endeared love to all that sincerely believe in, and unfeignedly love our blessed Lord, and for ever to be admired Saviour and adored advocate, Jesus Christ. With something of Christian advice, and seasonable counsel, for the encouraging of the faithful, to be noble in their confessing to, and owning of their glorious captain; and to contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the saints. From one who truly prises it above all visibles here below, in this fading world, to be found at last in the close of all, though but as one of the least of them, who are right dear and precious in the sight of the Lord.
