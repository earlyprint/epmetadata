         <note>William Trigg, practicioner of physick, who had ministered to the City of London for many years, including time of plague, was in danger of losing his ability to practice because of requests by the College of Physicians that Parliament enforce its act against those who are not physicians or surgeons practicing in London. The purpose of this petition is to plead for suspension of execution of the act in Trigg's case.</note>
