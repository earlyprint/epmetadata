      <title>A parallel or briefe comparison of the liturgie with the masse-book, the breviarie, the ceremoniall, and other romish ritualls. VVherein is clearly and shortly demonstrated, not onely that the liturgie is taken for the most part word by word out of these antichristian writts; but also that not one of the most abominable passages of the masse can in reason be refused by any who cordially imbrace the liturgie as now it stands, and is commented by the prime of our clergie. All made good from the testimonies of the most famous and learned liturgick writers both romish and English. By R.B.K. Seene and allowed.</title>
