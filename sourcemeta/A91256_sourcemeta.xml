         <title>A revindication of the anoynting and priviledges of faithfull subjects. Or, A briefe reply to an idle pamphlet, intituled, An answer and confutation of that groundlesse vindication of Psal. 105. 15. (touch not mine anoynted, and do my prophets no harme) from some trayterous exposition of schismaticks: declaring to the world, that this was spoken principally and peculiarly of kings, and not of inferiour subjects, &amp;c. Wherein the insufficiency and ridiculousnesse this Answerers no-answer, is briefly demonstrated, the Vindication justified, and the text of Rom. 13. cleared from some misconstructions (against subjects taking up meere defensive armes in any cases) which the Answerer (out of Dr. Fernes Resolution of conscience, for want of matter of his own) hath thrust upon it, to delude some scrupulous consciences. With a briefe exhortation to peace, with truth, righteousnesse, and holinesse.</title>
