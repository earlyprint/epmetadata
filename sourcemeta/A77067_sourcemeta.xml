         <title>The labyrinth the kingdom's in: with a golden threed to bring it forth into light, liberty, and peace agen. Being a brief but impartial history of the good and evil of the former, later, and present power of the nation, as it relates to God and the people. The result is a plea for the restauration of all in Christ (the kingdoms rest,) who is expected to appear more in the present, then in any former power of the nation. / By R. Bacon, a lover of mankinde.</title>
