      <title>A diurnall of sea designes, which is as strange as true. Relating vvhat great preparations many mighty forraigne princes have now upon the ocean, no man knowing for what intent or purpose. Wherein it may be perceived that the case is pittifull when so many dangers are floating about our ears befor wee can heare of them. Written for a warning, that though feares and jealousies be necessarie; yet it is more necessary to lay them in their right places. Not unprinted betwixt Yorke and Beverley, by W. H.</title>
