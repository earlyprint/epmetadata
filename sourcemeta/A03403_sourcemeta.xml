         <title>Two remarkable and true histories, which hapned this present yeare, 1619 The one relating how God most miraculously restored to health Elizabeth Goossens Taets, dwelling in the Long street neere St. Georges Church in Amers-ford by Vtrecht in the Low-countries, the 29. of August last, after fiue and twenty yeares great inabilitie and weaknesse of body. The other shewing how a maruellous deformed monster was found in the belly of a cow which was killed by Iohn Vandel malt-man of Amers-ford aforesaid, the first day of October last. 1619. Both which may serue to inuite vs to serious repentance and vnfained amendment of life, in this wicked and decaying age.</title>
