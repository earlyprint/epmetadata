The other shewing how a maruellous deformed monster was found in the belly of a cow which was killed by Iohn Vandel malt-man of Amers-ford aforesaid, the first day of October last. 1619. Both which may serue to inuite vs to serious repentance and vnfained amendment of life, in this wicked and decaying age.</title>
