         <title>Diapoliteia. A Christian concertation with Mr. Prin, Mr. Baxter, Mr. Harrington, for the true cause of the Commonvvealth. Or, An answer to Mr. Prin's (perditory) anatomy of the Republick, and his true and perfect narrative, &amp;c. To Mr. Baxter's (purgatory) pills for the Army: and his wounding answer to the healing question. With some soft reflections upon his Catholick (or rather Cathulactick) key; and an examen of the late petition of the sixth of July to this Parliament. In all which we have a most necessary vindication of the cause; of the honourable persons now in Parliament and Council, from the venome and vilification of their pens.  By Joh. Rogers, thorugh grace kept (under many sufferings) a faithful servant to Jesus Christ, his cause and the Commonwealth.</title>
