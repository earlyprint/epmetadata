         <title>A new ballad. The triumph of justice. Being the last speech and confession of nine malefactors, and betrayers of the lives and liberties of the good people of England. But few examples here are made of such as have our laws betray'd: the rest that have as ill deserv'd, for the next sessions are reserv'd. To the tune of Packington's pound.</title>
