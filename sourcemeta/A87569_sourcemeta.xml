      <title>Truths returne: in answer to a malignant pamphlet, pretended to be written by a most orthodox, moderate, and judicious divine, a banished minister of this miserable kingdom; to a vertuous lady, who (for the exercise of her devotion) built a closet, wherein to secure the most sacred Book of Common-Prayer, from the view and violence of the enemies thereof, sectaries and schismatiques of this kingdome. Being printed together; that thereby the great difference may appear, between prayer reall, and pretended: a forme of godlinesse, and the power thereof. / By Theo: Jennings, gent.</title>
