         <title>A survey of the heavens being a plain description of the admirable fabrick and motions of the heavenly bodies, as they are discovered to the eye by the telescope, and several eminent consequences illustrated thereby. I. The infinite wisdom, power, glory, and incomprehensibility of God in the creation. II. The verifying of the Copernican hypothesis. III. The probability of more inhabited worlds. IV. The clearing of some difficult places of scripture from doubtful interpretations. V. The higher exaltation of Gods attributes in the business of our redemption. VI. An essay to prove the Sun to be the seat of the blessed, with several other useful notions. To which is added the gout raptures. Augmented and improved in English, Latin, and Greek lyrick verse. By Robert Witty Dr in physick in both universities, and fellow of the Colledge of Physicians in London.</title>
