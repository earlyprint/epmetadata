      <title>A warning from the Lord God of life and power unto thee o city of London, and to the suburbs round about thee : to call thee and them to repentance &amp; amendment of life, without which you cannot see God : be ye separated from your priests, and from your idolatrous worship, and touch not the unclean thing, that the Lord may receive you ... and something also to the scattered seed of God, which hath been held in bondage under Pharaoh the Task-master : who am hated by the unwise, and foolish in heart, and am reproachfully call'd a Quaker / Ester Biddle.</title>
