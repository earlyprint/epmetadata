         <title>The Oxford health: or, The jovial Loyalist: a new song. We will be loyal and drink off our wine, though Pope or Presbyter should both repine; no state-affairs shall e're turmoil our brain, let those take care to whom they appertain: we'l love our King, and wish him happy days, and drink to all that dayly speak his praise; we'l loyal prove, and evermore will be with plotter and their plots at enmity. To the tune of, On the bank of a river: or, Packington's pound.</title>
