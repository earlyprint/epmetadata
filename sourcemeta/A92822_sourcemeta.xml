Also many choice points of law worthy every mans knowledge touching the illegallity of the former Act, and some seasonable proposals for the new; for for all mens view, but more especially for prisoners and creditors, and such as are upon their intrest concerned. Together with a tast of the salt sold at salters-hal, and in too many places of this Common-wealth, or certain cases instanced by which their justice may appear; published least men should be deceived or poisoned therewith.</title>
