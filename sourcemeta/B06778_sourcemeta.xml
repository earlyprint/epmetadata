      <title>The young-mans conquest over the powers of darkness. In a dialogue, between a virtuous young-man, and the subtile insinuating tempter; discovering the baits of Satan, and the strength of temptation: with the Christians fortitude, and only means of overcoming, which is by faith in Christ, and unwearied perseverance. Eph. 6. chap. 11. Put on the whole armour of God, that you may withstand the wiles of the devil. Necessary to be set up in all houses.</title>
