      <title>The vvalls of Ierico razed down to the ground. Or, An answer to a lying book, called the Quaking principles dashed in peices [sic]: wherein one called Henoch Howett, which goes under the name of an Anabahtist [sic], doth falsely accuse, and maliciously belye us; his seven principles which he calls ours, I shall lay down, and what we own is vindicated, and what he hath belyed the truth in, is turned upon his own head. / By one who is zealous for the name of the Lord of Hostes, called Edward Burrough.</title>
