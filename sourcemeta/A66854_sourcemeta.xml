         <title>A declaration of the tender mercies of the living Lord in causing his holy day to spring from on high, in this our age and generation, after a long night of darkness, that for many ages hath covered the earth and people. With a few words, from my own experience, of what I have found and tasted of the goodness of God in that way of the professors to the world esteem dangerous and erroneous; with a testimony, that it is the path of life, although such as are in the snares of death cannot ponder it, until they come to the light that leads to it.</title>
