         <title>An endevour after the reconcilement of that long debated and much lamented difference between the godly Presbyterians, and [the godly] Independents, about church-government. In a discourse touching the Iews synagogues. Proving, 1. that the Jews synagogue-assemblies were true visible churches of Jesus Christ. 2. that their government was ordained by Christ, to be dependent, when they lived together in the land of Canaan, [to be] independent, when they inhabited in heathen countries. 3 that schooles of learning were at the first erected by Jesus Christ, for the breeding of a succession of able men for pastors, teachers, elders, judges, &amp;c. to the worlds end. With many other miscellaneous observations about their synagogue-discipline.</title>
