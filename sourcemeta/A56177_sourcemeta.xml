         <title>A legal resolution of two important quæres of general present concernment Clearly demonstrating from our statute, common and canon laws, the bounden duty of ministers, &amp; vicars of parish-churches, to administer the sacraments, as well as preach to their parishioners; with the legal remedies to reclaim them from, or punish and remove them for their wilfull obstinacy in denying the sacraments to them. By William Prynne Esq; a bencher of Lincolns Inne; to whom these quæres were newly propounded by some clients.</title>
