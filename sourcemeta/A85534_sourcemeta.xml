         <title>The vindication of the vicar of Istleworth, in the county of Middlesex. From a scandalous pamphlet, contayning one and twenty articles; invented by some, closely; subscribed unto but by six, publiquely; presented but by one, openly; and now vented in print surreptitiously (in the name of the whole parish) by a no-body. Whereunto are likewise added certaine notorious impieties and misdeameanours of Gilbert Barrell attorney, the promoter: which shall be fairely and fully proved, upon just occasion. / By William Grant vicar of Istelworth aforesaid.</title>
