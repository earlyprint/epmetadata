         <title>A True relation of the birth of a monster born at Exeter, having two perfect heads, one head standing right as it should , the other being in the right shoulder, just as you see the figure here printed, a draught of it being sent up in a letter from a person of repute and integrity, who lived not far from the place where it was born, and was both an eye and an ear witness to the the truth of what he writ : it was born the 5th of this instant October, 1682, and lived not long, but was buried and taken up again the 10 instant, and many hundreds now resort to see it.</title>
