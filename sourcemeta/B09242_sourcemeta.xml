         <title>Something offered to the consideration of friends, with respect to the present difference about some things brought into the church of late, as for instance, the limit of a years time in the case of marriage, where the husband or wife is buried; as also that order that all persons that intend marriage, shall lay their intention before a womans meeting, distinct and apart from the men, &amp;c. which we forbear further to set forth, or particularly to speak to, at this time, because we would not make the breach wider than it must needs be, so shall content our selves in offering something in general, at present.</title>
