      <title>Nevvs from the Jews, or a true relation of a great prophet in the southern parts of Tartaria; pretending himself to be sent to gather together the Jews from all parts: as well the ten tribes that have so long abscronded themselves from the world; as the known tribes of Judah and Benjamin: promising to them the restoration of the land of Canaan, and all that they formerly enjoyed in the time of King Solomon. As it was communicated to Rabbi Josuah ben Eleazar, merchant in Amsterdam, by a letter from Adrianople. Faithfully translated into English, by Josephus Philo-Jud&#230;us, gent. With allowance.</title>
