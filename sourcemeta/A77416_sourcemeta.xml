         <title>A brief confession or declaration of faith. (Lately presented to King Charles the Second) set forth by many of us, who are (falsely) called Ana-baptists, to inform all men (in these days of scandal and reproach) of our innocent beleef and practise; for which wee are not only resolved to suffer persecution, to the losse of our goods, but also life it self, rather than to decline the same. Subscribed by certain elders, deacons, and brethren, met at London, in the behalf of themselves, and many others unto whom they belong; in London, and in several counties of this nation, who are of the same faith with us.</title>
