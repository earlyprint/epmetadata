         <title>The embassadour of peace, being a strange and wonderful relation of a white dove seated on a rain-bow. That appears to several persons, in the parish of Peter's Carlile; particularly to Mrs. Isabel Fletcher, (wife to Mr. Fletcher, apothecary.) To whom it relates strange and wonderful things, concerning the state of affairs in this nation; very positively asserting universal peace and plenty to all Christendom, the ensuing year 1697. Proving the subversion of the French king, from several texts of scripture; especially from the last verse of the 31st psalm. To which is added, its disputes with several ministers; as also its pious prayers and exhortations to all the people that dayly far and near flock to see it. The truth of all which, is confirm'd by the testimony of two letters, the one sent to the Reverend Dr. Simpson, and the other writ by the worshipful Justice Patrickson.</title>
