      <title>A cruell and bloudy battaile, betwixt the VVeymarish and Hessish, and the Imperialists, the like hath not happened these many yeeres. Fought betwixt Collen and VVeesel, the 12. 22. of last moneth, where it pleased God to give the victory to the Weymarish and Hessish. The names of the commanders both slain and taken prisoners. The exceeding great feare and danger Collen is now in. A faire opportunity being now offered to recover the Palatinate againe, if friends were both ready and willing.</title>
