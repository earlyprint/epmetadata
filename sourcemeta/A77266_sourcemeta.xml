         <title>Panthalia: or The royal romance. A discourse stored with infinite variety in relation to state-government and passages of matchless affection gracefully interveined, and presented on a theatre of tragical and comical state, in a successive continuation to these times. Faithfully and ingenuously rendred.</title>
