         <title>Mathematical divinity, or A plain demonstration from the Holy Scriptures, that the times of this world were fore appointed by the Covenant made with Abraham: and determined to be according to the measure of the age and fulness of Christ. Kept secret since the world began, but is now made plain upon XII. tables, in a solar calendar, as familiar to the understanding as any common almanack. With full proof that this is the last generation, which shall not pass away 'till all things be fulfilled, and the gates of righteousness be opened. Being the result of many years study. / By Elias Palmer.</title>
