      <title>A soveraign antidote to prevent, appease, and determine our unnaturall and destructive civill warres and dissentions. Wherein divers serious considerations tending to this purpose are propounded both to the King and subjects, the Parliaments and Sir Iohn Hothams proceedings at Hull and in the militia justified, Sr Iohn Hothams actions proved to be neither treason, felony, nor trespas, by the laws of the land, nor any just ground or cause at all for his Majestie to rayse an army, or a most unnaturall civill warre in his kingdome. With a most serious exhortation both to the King and subjects to embrace and preserve peace and abandon civill warres, with other matters worthy of consideration.</title>
