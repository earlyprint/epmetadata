         <title>A Christian plea for Christians baptisme: raised from the grave of apostasie. or, a short treatise, being a reproof of some things written by A. R. in his treatise, intituled, The vanitie of childish baptisme. In the answer whereof, the lawfulnesse of infants baptisme is defended, the sufficiency of our baptisme received in the state of apostasie, shewed: and the deficiencie of the arguments brought against it manifested, by sufficient grounds and reasons drawn from the sweet fountains of holy Scripture. / [by] S.C.</title>
