      <title>A second narrative of the late Parliament (so called) wherein, after a brief reciting some remarkable passages in the former narrative, is given an account of their second meeting, and things transacted by them : as also how the Protector (so called) came swearing, by the living God, and dissolved them, after two or three weeks sitting : with some qu&#230;ries sadly proposed thereupon : together with an account of three and forty of their names, who were taken out of the house, and others that sate in the other house, intended for a House of Lords, but being so unexpectedly disappointed, could not take root, with a brief character and description of them : all humbly presented to publique view /  by a friend to the good old cause of justice, righteousnesse, the freedom and liberties of the people, which hath cost so much bloud and treasury to be carried on in the late wars, and are not yet settled.</title>
