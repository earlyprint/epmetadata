      <title>Christ's voice to sinners: or, Christ waiting at the door of the sinner's heart for entrance. Wherein is shewn from Scripture how wonderful desirous the Lord Jesus is to get into every poor sinner's heart.  With many motives to perswade every poor sinner to open the door of their hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ.  As also several true characters of a real sound Christian, and the marks of a hypocrite or false professor, shewing how far a professor may go, and yet be but almost a Christian.  Being of excellent use to all those that desire to know how the case stands between them and their souls / by T.O. D.D.</title>
