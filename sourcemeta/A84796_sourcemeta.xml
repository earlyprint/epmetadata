      <title>A message from the Lord, to the Parliament of England. That you may all take warning, and be ye all forewarned, that you act not in the steps of your forefathers, whom the Lord hath cast out as an abominable thing, as he hath done all rulers in all ages and generations, which have sought themselves, and established laws in their own wills, whereby the just have suffered, and now do suffer: the people which the Lord hath chosen are trodden upon, and the powers of the earth have set themselves against the mighty power of the Lord in them. But now is the Lord arising to plead the cause of the just, and woe for ever to all Sions adversaries. / By him who is a lover of your souls, and a lover of Israels common-wealth, whom the Lord is returning out of captivity, to serve him in their own land in perfect freedom. Geo. Fox.</title>
