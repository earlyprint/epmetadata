         <title>A Looking-glasse for, or an awakening word to the superiour and inferiour officers, with all others, belonging to the Armies of England, Scotland, and Ireland; more especially to those, who have the least spark of grace or principles of true honesty remaining in them. Wherein is set before them, and presented to the world, some passages contained in severall of their declarations, remonstrances, and engagements, &amp;c. speciously pretending for the just rights and liberties of the people, in the way of a common wealth, opposed to monarchy; and more especially, for the advancement of the kingdome of Christ, and his Saints ruling for him till he comes himself. With some marginall annotations, whereby (in some measure) is manifested how evidently they are declined and turned aside from the principles of justice and righteousness, therein contained. As also how they justifie the proceedings of those, who (in the prosecution of these principles of justice and righteousnesse,) shall oppose their back-slidings.</title>
