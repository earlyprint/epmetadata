      <title>Loves revenge VVherein is briefly shewed from the historie of the holy scripture, the rising, grouth, and finall fall of the man of sinne; with the long and continuall strife betwixt the two seeds, how they have, from time to time, sought to disinherite each other: and how that Christ, by his righteous life, and long sufferings, in the end shall get the victory, and justly revenge himself upon his adversarie. Omnia vincit amor, &amp; c. By Ios. Speed.</title>
