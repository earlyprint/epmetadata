         <title>A salutation of love unto all who have known the call of God and have in measure believed therein so far as to make open confession to his name and truth, and yet sit down short of the heavenly possession, through want of faithfulness thereunto, so come not to witness a being gathered into God's vineyard, to labour therein, which alone obtains the reward, and fits for his heavenly kingdom / by Richard Vickris.</title>
