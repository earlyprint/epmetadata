         <title>The entrie to Christianitie, or, An admonition to householders very necessary for instruction of their families, as also others, whereby, with some some small labour, they may attaine to the vnderstanding of the Christian faith: (if holy, and Christian exercises, as prayers, and such sanctified meanes) be devoutly vsed. Drawne out of the sacred Scriptures, as also prooued by the iudgement of famous learned writers. Very fit for this diseased and sickly age, where-in popish ignorance and deuilish atheisme dooth so abound. By Thomas Wats, minister of the word of God.</title>
