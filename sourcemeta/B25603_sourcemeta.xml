      <title>A confutation of infants baptisme, or an answer, to a treatice written by Georg Phillips, of Wattertowne in New England, in the defence of infants baptisme denying the true church to be formed by baptisme, and affirming it to be formed by a covenant acted by a company of believers, to become one, and anothers amongst themselves. Wherein, is plainely discovered that neither infants baptisme, nor yet such a covenant acted, can be Gods ordinance appointed by him for such end, as to constitute true visable churches: as also that baptisme of beleevers, and that only is Gods ordinance whereby true visible churches are rightly constituted and stated in their true being.
