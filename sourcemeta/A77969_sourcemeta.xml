      <title>Truth (the strongest of all) witnessed forth in the spirit of truth, against all deceit: and pleading in righteousnesse its owne cause, to the understanding of the simple, against a very great number of lyes, slanders, perverting of the Scriptures, contradictions and false damnable doctrines, held forth by the Independants. And in particular by one John Bunion, (one of Gogs Army) in two severall bookes put forth by him, against the despised scattered people called Quakers. And is a reply unto his second book, called A vindication, &amp;c. wherein what was wanting in his former of fulfilling wickednesse is now appeared; by his adding sin unto sin, against God and against his owne soule. And this is to cleer the truth from above 100 of John Bunions foule dirty lyes and slanders: by a friend of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus; and not as it is in mens carnall apprehensions, Edward Burrough.</title>
