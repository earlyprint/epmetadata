         <title>An untaught teacher witnessed against. Or, The old bottles mouth opened, it's wine poured forth, drunk of drunkards, denyed of them who have tasted of the new. That is to say, the unsound, unseasoned, unsavory doctrines, and opinions of Matthew Caffyn, Baptist-teacher laid open, who in the county of Sussex, is cryed up to be as their battle axe, and weapon of warre, who as Jannes and Jambres rides aloft, and bestirs himself with the magick rod of his lies, slanders, aspersions, and unsound doctrines, labours to strengthen the hands of carnal professors, and to keep the beloved of God in bondage: ... Which doctrines, and unsavory speeches were received from his own mouth, part of them at a meeting of the people called Quakers, at Crowley in Sussex, others thereof at his own house neere South-water, before me and John Slee, upon the fifth day of the seventh moneth, 1655 ... / Tho: Lawson.
