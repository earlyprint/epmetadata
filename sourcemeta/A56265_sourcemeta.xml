      <title>Brittish and out-landish prophesies most of above a 1000 years antiquity, the rest very antient; fore-telling the several revolutions which hath and shall befall the scepter of England; the coming in of the Normans, continuance and extirpation; the late warrs; the late Kings death; his Highness's conquest and arrival to the scepter, sovereigntie and government of Great Brittain; the fall of the Turk, Pope, Emperour of Germany, and most of the great princes of the world by their particular names; and that his Highness that now is shall conquer most of them: also, his Highness's lineal descent from the antient princes of Brittain, clearly manifesting that hee is the conquerour they so long prophesied of. Also, a short account of the late kings original; published in Welsh and English for the satisfaction of the intelligent in either tongue. By Thomas Pugh, Gentleman.</title>
