         <title>An explanation of the commission of Jesus Christ; in relation to the gifts, call, mission, qualification, work and maintenance of his ministers under the gospel-dispensation. Compared with the gifts, call, mission, qualification, work, and maintenance, of the titular clergy of this commonwealth. Humbly submitted to the judgement of the committe, in relation to tythes; to the end they may see the contradiction betwixt them, and so deal with them accordingly.
