         <title>A godly guide of directions for true penitent sinners in these troubled times. That we call to God to be our friend, to think upon our latter end, mans life is short and at no stay wee almost have a dying day, that God may guide us along, to bring us to our heavenly home, where our souls may live and ever rest with heavenly angels that are blest. Tune is, Aim not too high. / by Robert Tipping.</title>
