      <title>An honest ansvver to the late published apologie for private preaching wherein is justly refuted their mad forms of doctrine, as, preaching in a tub, teaching against the backe of a chaire, instructing at a tables end, revealing in a basket, exhorting over a buttery hatch, reforming on a bed side : with an objection to their common plea of divine inspiration, directly, without passion, proving there is but nice distinction betwixt the brownists and papists who have bin equall disturbers of the state yet in continuall controversie one against the other : with an argument against Round-heads / by T. J.</title>
