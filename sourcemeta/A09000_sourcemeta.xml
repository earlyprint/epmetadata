      <note>A translation of an anonymous Latin manuscript life of Matthew Parker, taken from the "Historiola Collegii Corporis Christi" sometimes attributed to John Joscelyn and probably composed under Parker's direction. This unauthorized translation, possibly by John Stubbs, adds deprecatory marginal comments and an attack on Parker's "De antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae et privilegiis Ecclesiae Cantuariensis".</note>
