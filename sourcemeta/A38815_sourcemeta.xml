      <note>By Mary Evelyn.</note>
      <note>The preface was probably written by John Evelyn, the author's father.</note>
      <note>Partly in verse.</note>
      <note>"The fop-dictionary" has separate dated title page; pagination and register are continuous.</note>
      <note>Apparently there are two editions with "second edition" on the title page. In each edition quire A is in the same setting of type, but quires B-D have been reset. In this edition the separate dated title page line 2 has a semi-colon following "fop-dictionary" and the "C" of signature-mark "C2" is partly under the "n" and "d" of "understood".</note>
      <note>Reproduction of the original in the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library.</note>
