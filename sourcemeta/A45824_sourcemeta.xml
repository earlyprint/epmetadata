         <title>The corrector corrected: or, some sober reflections on a late book of Mr. Thomas Danson's published by him (as he pretends) to correct an immodest and false account (as he calls it) of two conferences between him and Mr. Ives, formerly printed about the saints perseverance. By which the former accounts of the said disputations are justified, and Mr. Danson's latter account justly blamed, as being filled with impertinencies, railings, false accusations, unchristian and unmanly reflections upon the person, opinion, and trade of his antagonist. Evidenced to the judgment of every ingenious reader. By Jer. Ives.</title>
