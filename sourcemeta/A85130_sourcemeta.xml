         <title>The brazen serpent lifted up on high, or truth cleared and above the deceit exalted, and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wildernesse: even so must the son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish but have eternall life. Joh. 3. 14. 15. Here is also laid down in this treatise something, concerning election and and [sic] predestination, which is so much spoken of, and how they may know their election, something concerning Christ being the way to the Father; and how, and concerning Christ, the mediatour of the new covenants, and the end of the old, and tythes are ended. ... Lastly, here is part of a dispute, held between two chief priests, and two men that came and met with them, and the people at Chadwitch in Worcestershire; ... to clear the truth form accusations, held forth by those men that the world scornfully calleth Quakers. Written in Worcestershire, the beginning of the first moneth called March. 1655.</title>
