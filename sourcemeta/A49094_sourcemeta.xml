         <title>London's flames being an exact and impartial account of divers informations given in to the committee of Parliament, by divers members of Parliament, and many other persons of quality (whose names are inserted in this book) concerning the dreadful fire of London in the year 1666, and the many other strange fires which have happened since : together with what was said by M. Langhorn, now a prisoner, and condemned for the horrid Popish Plot, concerning the great fire : wherein is plainly proved, that the papists were the contrivers and actors in the burning of that great and noble city.</title>
