         <title>Saul smitten for not smiting Amalek according to the severity of the command: and the residue of the spoil sentenced to death, which Saul preserved and spared alive, (to wit) man, woman, infant, suckling, oxe, sheep, camel and ass. Being an allegorical allusion to the present passages of the times, delivered in a sermon at Somerset-House, May 1. upon the dissolution of the late Parliament. Also, a great and notable blow is given at the serpent, the ruine of the whore and her familie determined; wherein is discovered what she was, and is, and the several husbands that have married her, deceased from her, and been decieved by her; also the several children which by her have been brought forth and nursed up, with a dissolution of all unjust government, laws rules and worships exercised over mens lives, liberties and estates, and the restoring of all just government, the peoples rights and priviledges by the Lord Jesus, into its perfect state. As apprehended by Richard Coppin.</title>
