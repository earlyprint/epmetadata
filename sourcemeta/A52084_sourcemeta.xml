      <title>Two sorts of latter days, proved from Scripture. First, the latter days of perilous times, the which are to be ended before the great and glorious latter days have their beginning. Proved when the elder people or nation is to serve the younger. And by that servitude made blessed. The old and new testament made to agree. And truth vindicated against all heresies. By M. Marsin</title>
