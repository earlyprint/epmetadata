         <title>An Exact and necessary catalogue of pentioners in the Long Parliament together, with their several gratuities, rewards, and sallaries, bestowed upon themselves, out of the ruins of king, and kingdom, (not for secret, but) for public service, (if you will believe them) as Mr. William Prinn, (a member in the same Parliament, and a restless stickler in all those revolutions) and the history of independency (printed in the year 1648) informs us : which may serve for an answer to the preface to the history of the standing army.</title>
