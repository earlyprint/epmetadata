      <title>A brief iustification of the XI. accused members, from a scandalous libel, stiled A particular charge and impeachment, in the name of Sir Thomas Fairfax, and the army under him: newly printed and published to defame them. Wherein the apparent falshood and malice of some of the most materiall charges, is demonstrated to the world, for the present; till the rest be fully cleared in time by themselves, to the eternal infamy of the fals accusers, not any of them as yet daring to own and make good the generall or particular charge, in their own names under their hands, as by law they ought.</title>
