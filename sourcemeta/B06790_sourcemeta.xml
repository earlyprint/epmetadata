         <title>The blemish of government, the shame of religion, the disgrace of mankinde; or, A charge drawn up against drunkards, and presented to His Highness the Lord Protector, in the name of all the sober partie in the three nations. Humbly craving, that they may be kept alone by themselves from infecting others; compelled to work and earn what they consume : and that none may be suffered to sell drink, who shall either swear, or be drunk themselves, or suffer others within their walls. / By R. Younge of Roxwell in Essex.</title>
