         <title>A true and strange discourse of the trauailes of two English pilgrimes what admirable accidents befell them in their iourney to Ierusalem, Gaza, Grand Cayro, Alexandria, and other places: also what rare antiquities, monuments, and notable memories (concording with the ancient remembrances in the holy Scriptures), they saw in Terra Sancta, with a perfect description of the old and new Ierusalem, and scituation of the countries about them. A discourse of no lesse admiration; then well worth the regarding: written by one of them, on the behalfe of himselfe, and his fellowe pilgrime.</title>
