         <title>A short account of Dr. Bentley's humanity and justice, to those authors who have written before him with an honest vindication of Tho. Stanley, Esquire, and his notes on Callimachus : to which are added, some other observations on that poet : in a letter to the Honourable Charles Boyle, Esq. : with a postscript, in relation to Dr. Bentley's late book against him : to which is added an appendix, by the bookseller : wherein the doctor's mis-representations of all the matters of fact wherein he is concern'd, in his late book about Phalaris's Epistles, are modestly considered : with a letter from the Honourable Charles Boyle, Esq., on that subject.</title>
