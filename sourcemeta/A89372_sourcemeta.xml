         <title>The most strange and wounderfull apperation of blood in a poole at Garraton in Leicester-shire, which continued for the space of foure dayes, the rednesse of the colour for the space of those foure dayes every day increasing higher and higher, to the infinet amazement of many hundreds of beholders of all degrees and conditions, who have dipped their handketchers in this bloody poole, ... As also the true relation of a miraculous and prodigious birth in Shoo-lane, where one Mistris Browne a cuttlers wife was delivered of a monster without a head or feet, and in stead of a head had a hollow out of which a child did proceed, which was little but lovely, perfect in all but very spare and leane. As also the Kings sending to his Parliament for hostage for the security of his person to come unto London and to sit with his parliament for the composing the diffirences in the kingdome.</title>
