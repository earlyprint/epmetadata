      <title>An ansvver to the articles against Master Calamy, Master Martiall, Master Burton, Master Peters, Master Moleigne, Master Case, M. Sedgwicke, M. Evans, &amp;c. and many other painfull divines who were impeached of high treason by His Majesty : first answering particularly the articles themselves, then shewing the mis-information of His Majestie by the bishops, concerning the same : expressing the great care and vigilancy of those theologians which they have and doe daily undertake with great zeale for the rooting out of popery the confounding of Rome and for the erecting the pious truth and sincerity of the holy gospel of Christ.</title>
