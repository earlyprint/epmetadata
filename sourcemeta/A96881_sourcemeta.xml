         <title>An appeal to the churches of Christ for their righteous judgement in the matters of Christ, the concernments of all His glory, over whom there is a defence. Whether the way of Christ with His people be not paved-forth as a cause-way before them in His scriptures, and to be traced by the footsteps of all His neare-ones. Here you have the epistles only. The first to the churches, giving them some short account of their matters. The second unto the minister who enjoyned that work. The second unto the minister who enjoyned that work. The third to some neighbour-ministers for their judgement therein. The fourth to the Christian reader.</title>
