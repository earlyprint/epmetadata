      <title>A letter or epistle to all well-minded people in England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. Written by Lieut. Col. Joyce, for the undeceiving of the good people, July 7. 1651. That which moved me hereunto, was a consideration of the evils to come upon those that seek to obstruct justice; fearing least some would bring themselves into a snare, as others have formerly done in the like case.</title>
