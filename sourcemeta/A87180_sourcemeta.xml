      <title>The prerogative priests passing-bell. Or Amen to the rigid clergy. Shewing the usefulness, equity, lawfulness, and necessity, of private persons to take upon them preaching or expounding of the scriptures, having a call thereto by the word of God, and agreeable to the practise of the best reformed churches of Christ, and judgment of judicious divines both forraign and domestick. Being a brief reply to that discourse intituled The pulpit guarded with 17 arguments, and owned by Tho. Hall. Calculated on purpose for the metropolis of Northamptonshire, and may serve indifferently for those parts that are in conjunction with the northern climate. / By William Hartley.</title>
