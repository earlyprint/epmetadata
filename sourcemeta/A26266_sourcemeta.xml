      <title>The axe at the root of the innovation of singing in the worship of God lately sprung up to the trouble of many, and the defiling of others. Or, some brief queries; with an introduction proposed to the singers in the popular way of singing Psalms, as translated, and tunes as invented, and as now sung together by the professor and prophane, as an ordinance of God. Designed for the preservation of right worship, especially in the churches of Christ, that have upon the declaration of their faith been baptized. By a Baptist.</title>
