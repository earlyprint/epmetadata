      <title>Hugh Peters figaries: or, His merry tales, and witty jests both in city, town &amp; countreys. In a pleasant and historical discourse; shewing, 1. His merry pranks and conjurations, betwixt the miller and his wife, and the parson of the town in a kneading trough; with their several speeches. 2. How Mr. Peters was [illegible] by the butchers wife; and how he lighted the blind harper. With the rare conceits upon the citizens wives. 3. How he pretended to cloath Christ in a biff-coat; his opening of heaven gates to a committee-man; and how he looked for that monster Oliver Cromwel, but could not find him. With many other delightful stories. Licensed according to order.</title>
