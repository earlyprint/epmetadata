      <title>A vvarning from the Lord to the inhabitants of Underbarrovv, and so to all the inhabitants in England, where it shall meet with them, who holds up the false teachers, and false worship, and who beats, stone, stock, and persecute, and hail out of their assemblies, those who are sent by the Lord, to speak his word freely; with an exhortation, that they hast to meet the Lord by true repentance, by putting off the works of darkness, lest the Lord cut them assunder, by his sword, which is already drawn and put into the hand of his servants. Also, a word to my brethren, and companions in tribulation in the kingdome and patience of Jesus Christ, who is by the world scornfully called Quakers. With the manner of my passage through the dark world, (wherein the simple ones may see the deceits of the man of sin in his actings like the true spirit) to warn all to follow the true light within, which leads unto God, &amp; to beware of the voice, lo here &amp; lo there, by one who is a labourer in the vineyard, who is not known to the world; (though named of the world) Edvvard Burrough.</title>
