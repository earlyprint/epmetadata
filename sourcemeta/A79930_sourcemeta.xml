      <title>The cleere sense: or, A just vindication of the late ordinance of Parliament; forbidding persons not ordained, or not allowed of, as intending the ministry, to preach, from such malignant interpretations as some ill-affected labour to fasten on it, therby to authorize their opposition against those other most warrantable duties of expounding scriptures, mutuall edification, &amp;c. which the scriptures do require of every Christian within his own sphear and relations. Which may also serve for an usefull caution to those gentlemen of the magistracy, souldiery &amp; committees in the severall towns, garrisons, places of strength, cities, counties, througout the kingdome, to whom the said ordinance is respectively recommended by both Houses of Parliament.
