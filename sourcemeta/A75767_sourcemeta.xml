         <title>Davids enemies discovered. VVho of him make songs, but without the Spirit and without understanding, as the drunkard did which he declares of in Psal. 69.12. Or, a true discovery of that custome and forme which the priests of this generation would make an ordinance of, to blind the eyes of the simple, as this priest Clapham: in his 6 arguments, which is here answered, / by us who suffer for the truth, whose names according to the flesh are [brace] Christopher Atkinson. George Whitehead. Also a brief reply unto Frederick Woodall's three principles and resolves; and with replies to his answers, to several queries propounded to him, that to the simple the truth may be cleared, from one who for the captivated seeds sake suffers now in outward bonds in Norwitch Castle, whose name in the flesh is Richard Hubberthorne.</title>
