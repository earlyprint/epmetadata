      <title>A declaration of the Lords of His Majesties Privie-Councell in Scotland; and commissioners for conserving the articles of the treaty: for the information of His Majesties good subjects of this kingdom. Together with a treacherous and damnable plot of the Irish, English, and Scottish papists, begun to be discovered by the unexpected apprehending of the Earl of Antrim coming from York; partly by letters which were found in the said Earls pockets, and partly by the depositions of a servant of his, who was hanged at Carrick-Fergus.</title>
