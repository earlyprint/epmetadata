      <title>A most humble mem[o]randum from Peter Blondeau, concerning the offers made to him by this Commonwealth, for the coyning of the monie, by a new invention, not yet practised in any state of the world, the which will prevent counterfeiting, casting, washing, and clipping of the same : which coyn shall be marked on both the flat sides, and about the thickness or the edge ; of a like bigness and largness, as the ordinarie coyn is : and will cost no more than the ordinarie unequal coyn, which is used now.</title>
