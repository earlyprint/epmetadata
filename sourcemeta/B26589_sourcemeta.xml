      <title>This treatise proving three worlds, fou[n]dations, mentioned in Scripture whereby it is clearly made apparent, that none were elected before the foundation of the material heavens and earth, and likewise that the eternal purpose only reacheth forward to the eternity that is before us, that the decree for entring into life was made strait after Adam fell : two sorts of elections proved by the word, with the day of grace, or an offer of mercy to all that will upon the conditions take hold of it, which all Israel had, till they forfeited it by their not yielding obedience : there are also several controversial places answered, the tree of life, and the tree of knowledge explained.</title>
