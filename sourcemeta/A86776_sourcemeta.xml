         <title>The humble petition of many thousands of wives and matrons of the city of London, and other parts of this kingdome, for the cessation and finall conclusion of these civill wars, and for the restitution and revocation of their hvsbands, who have as just cause to complaine for the want of them, together with our children and bosome friends, as the virgins have for losing their sweet-hearts. Presented by divers gentlewomen of good credit, and citizens wives; to the considerations of both Houses, on Thursday, the second of February.</title>
