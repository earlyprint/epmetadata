      <title>A declaration of the Christian-free-born subjects of the once flourishing kingdom of England. Making out the principles relating both to their spiritual and civil liberties, which they conceive they are bound both in conscience and honour, to vindicate and maintain with sobriety and courage, each one in his proper place and sphere: against all usurpation. To which is adjoyned the Petition of Right, the Oath of Allegiance, the Oath of Supremacy, the Protestation, and the Solemn Vow and Covenant: by perusal of which, the nation may see the necessity of repentance for perjury, and amendment of errours.</title>
