         <title>The first and second parts of Invisible John made visible: or A grand pimp of tyranny portrayed, in Barksteads arraignment at the barre, vvhere he stands impeached of high treason, and other gross misdemeanours, as the late tyrant's bum-bailiff, in his most arbltrary [sic], oppressive and tyrannical invasions of the rights and liberties of English-men, within the late cantonized county of Middlesex, the City of London, Tower, &amp;c. Whereunto is added, his barbarous cruelty to that eminent and reverend divine Dr. Iohn Hevvyt and others. Together with five queries to the Parliament, Council of State, and Army, occasioned by the preceding plea for justice; but not unworthy of their perusal.</title>
