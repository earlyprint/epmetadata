      <title>Saul's errand to Damascus, with his packet of letters from the high priests against the disciples of the Lord, or, A faithful transcript of a petition contrived by some persons in Lancashier who call themselves ministers of the Gospel breathing out threatnings and slaughters against a peaceable &amp; godly people there, by them nick-named Quakers : together with the defence of the persons thereby traduced against, the slanderous and false suggestions of that petition, and other untruths charged upon them : published to no other end but to draw out the bowels of tender compassion from all that love the poor despised servants of Jesus Christ, who have been the scorn of carnal men in all ages.</title>
