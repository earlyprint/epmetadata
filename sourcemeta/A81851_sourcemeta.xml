         <title>A warning to the Parliament of England. A discovery of the ends and designes of the Popish partie both abroad, and at home, in the raising and fomenting our late war, and still-continuing troubles : in an oration made to the generall Assembly of the French clergy in Paris, / by Monsieur Jaques du Perron Bishop of Angolesme, and Grand Almosner to the Queen of England. Translated out of a manuscript copy, obtained from a good hand in France, and now published for the opening their eyes that hate not the truth, and that desire to be thankfull for such a discovery. And for caution to those, to whom the Divine Providence hath intrusted the transaction of affaires, that they may most accurately take heed there be a sound foundation laid, of the so generally longed-for peace of the kingdome.</title>
