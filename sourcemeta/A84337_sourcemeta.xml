      <title>The axe, against sin and error; and the truth conquering. A sermon on Matthew 3. 10. Now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees, therefore every tree, that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire. At which, a Christian confessed, she was converted; and because it did good to her, desired it might be preached again at her funerall, that it might do good to others, ... wherein are shewed the causes of the sword upon England, and on the Lutherans, and the remedies that must be used, before the judgements cease. / Written by John Eachard, M. A. of Trin. Col. Camb. and pastor of Darsham in Suffolke. Published according to order.</title>
