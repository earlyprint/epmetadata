      <note>Recounts the history of the war. Urges that the Commons are the supreme authority. The Lords have no real share in it, and if they have they may be treated like the bishops. Gives 27 things expected from them including abolition of the Lords and royal veto, annual parliaments, universal trial by jury, abolishment of tithes, municipal reformation, and granting of liberty of conscience. Hints at trial of the king -- Cf. Steele.</note>
