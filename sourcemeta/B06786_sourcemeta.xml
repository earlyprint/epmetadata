      <title>The young-mans victory over the povver of the devil. Or, Strange and vvonderful news from the city of London; being a full and true relation of a vertuous young-man, who being but fifteen years of age, living in the parish of St. Giles's, was wonderfully tempted by the devil: discovering the baits of the devil, and how he followed him from place to place, wheresoever he did go, ... Whereupon the youth immediately fell down upon his knees, praying to Almighty God, that he might be able to overcome the wiles and temptations of the subtile deceiver.</title>
