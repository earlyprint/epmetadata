      <title>Something written in answer to a lying, scandalous book printed for E.B. in Pauls Church-yard, as he calls it, whose lies and slanders are denied by the children of Light, who in scorn are called Quakers, which book is proved to be a work of darkness: the author of it is said to be called Powel, who sold a copy of it for ten shillings, and now and then a flagon of beer, and would not have his name declared: so here your fruits is known of your trees, which are to be cut down and cast into the fire, and when you are there, remember you were warned. Also a declaration against the lies and slanders which are printed for G: Horton, that upon the truth they should not rest, but with the power and life of God be denyed; and who sees the end of them who makes lies their refuge, who are swept away with the beesom of destruction; which shall be witnessed with that of God in every one of your consciences: and them whom you in scorn call Quakers, from them is given forth who are in the Light that comprehends your deceits, seeth them that they are to be condemned with the Light.</title>
