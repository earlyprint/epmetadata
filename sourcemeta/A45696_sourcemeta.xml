      <title>The history of the union of the four famous kingdoms of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland wherein is demonstrated that by the prowess and prudence of the English, those four distinct and discordant nations have upon several conquests been entirely united and devolved into one commonwealth, and that by the candor of clemency and deduction of colonies, alteration of laws, and communication of language, according to the Roman rule, they have been maintained &amp; preserved in peace and union / by a Lover of truth and his country.</title>
