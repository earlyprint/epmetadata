      <title>Olimpya's unfortunate love: or Gallius his treacherous cruelty. A new song, as it is sung in a play, called, The Spanish fryer. At the Dukes theatre, with great applause. Fairest Olimpia at last being won, did yield to Gallius, who has her undone, her honour's lost, and he does her neglect his ends being gain'd he shews her no respect: but flies her arms, whilst that false man she crys, and in her blood her fatal dagger dyes. To a pleasant new play-house tune.</title>
