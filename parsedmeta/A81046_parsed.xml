      <title>Tythes no property to, nor lawful maintenance for a powerful Gospel-preaching ministry. Or A compulsory maintenance for Christs ministers is contrary to Christs doctrine and example of his apostles and the example of the faithful ministers of Christ, and famous reformers in all ages, as VVickliffe, Hus, and divers others, with an old prophecy written by Iohn Hus, as it is recorded by Fox in his Acts and monuments, commonly called the Book of martyrs. With a discovery of the marks of the false prophets and ministers in all ages (as they are found recorded in the ecclesiastical history) since the apostles days to this very time agreeing with the Scriptures of truth both of the Old and New Testament. Written by a lover of the souls of all men, Iohn Crook.</title>
