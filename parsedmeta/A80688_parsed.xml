         <title>The countreys plea against tythes. A declaration sent to divers eminent ministers in severall parishes of their kingdome, shewing the grounds and causes wherefore tythes ought to be detained: proving by Gods Word and morall reason, that tythes are not due to ministers of the Gospell; and that the law for tythes was a Leviticall law, and to indure no longer than the Leviticall priesthood did; and that there being a change of the priesthood, there ought to be also a change of maintenance thereof. Written for the generall benefit of all, as well ministers as people. Published according to order.</title>
