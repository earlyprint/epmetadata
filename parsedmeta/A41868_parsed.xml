      <note>Often erroneously ascribed to Thomas Hunt.  Hunt's pamphlet entitled "The great and weighty considerations relating to the Duke of York or successor of the crown : offered to the King and both Houses of Parliament ... 1680" was written in response to this pamphlet by a true patriot.  Cf. Halkett &amp; Laing; Lincoln's Inn catalogue of pamphlets, p. 272; Brit. Mus. cat. under James II, col. 35; DNB; and Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, v. 4, col. 82.</note>
