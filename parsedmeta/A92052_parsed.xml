      <title>The royal project: or A clear discovery of his Majesties design in the present treaty. Whereunto is annexed a seasonable caution for the Parliament of England, the Army under the command of Tho. Lord Fairfax, and all that thirst to be for ever freed from a long established course of tyranny, and to see this nation restored to its pristine glory, freedom, and tranquility. Wherein the rottenness of the present treaty, and the impossiblility of making the people thereby secure, and absolutely free, is palpably declared, and detected. / By Verity Victor.</title>
