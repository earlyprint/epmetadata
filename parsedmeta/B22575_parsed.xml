      <title>An essay, or, modest proposal of a way to encrease the number of people, and consequently the strength of this kingdom; to improve the woollen manufacture, and raise the values of land, of corn, cattle, and most other things of the product and growth of England; and raise a considerable sum of money to their Majesties, and that after such a manner as will be very much for the advantage of the kingdom: out of which might be settled a fund for the encouragement and maintenance of distressed and disabled mariners or sea-men, or what else should be thought more convenient. With all dutiful respect most humbly offered to the consideration of the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled.</title>
