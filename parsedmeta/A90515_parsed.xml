         <title>A messenger from the dead, or, Conference full of stupendious horrour, heard distinctly, and by alternate voyces, by many at that time present. Between the ghosts of Henry the 8. and Charls the First of England, in Windsore-Chappel, where they were both buried. In which the whole series of the divine judgments, in those infortunate ilands, is as it were by a pencil from heaven, most lively set forth from the first unto the last.</title>
