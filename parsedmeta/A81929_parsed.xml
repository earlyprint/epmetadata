      <title>The plain way of peace and unity in matters of religion. Shewed by some maxims supposed to be undeniable, which John Durie hath made use of in negotiating with all the churches. And by some expedients supposed to be effectual, which he hath endeavoured to make practicable among the churches, for the preserving and promoting of the Protestant religion abroad. And now are offered for the preventing of further breaches, and the settlement of unity amongst our selves at home.</title>
