         <title>The Kings chronicle latter section. Wherein the way, the good kings, priest and people have taken for the well-posturing the kingdom, is fully declared, and made glorious before the eye of the beholder by Gods own right hand, for the encouragement of all, who will walk in the same way, observe the same steps and motions there; and fixe their eye upon the same marke, the glory of God; their owne and the peoples safety.
