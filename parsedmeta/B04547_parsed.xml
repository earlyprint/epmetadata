         <title>A new ballad of the three merry butchers, and ten high-way men, how three butchers went to pay five hundred pounds away, and hearing a woman crying in the vvood, went to relieve her and was there set upon by the ten high-way men; and how only stout Johnson fought with them all; who killed eight of the ten; and at last was killed by the woman he went to save in the wood. To an excellent new tune.</title>
