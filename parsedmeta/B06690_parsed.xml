      <title>The womens just complaint: or, Mans deceitfulness in love. Being a most pleasant new play-house song. Long time deceiv'd with feigned vows, at last, the females find their coyness holds not fast; for man, that noble creature, cannot love, nor fix his soul on ought but what's above: 'tis everlasting joy he centers on, and leaves soft fools, women to dote upon; which once they finding, seem to loose their care of hopes they had, and fall to flat dispair. To a pleasant new play-house tune, much in request.</title>
