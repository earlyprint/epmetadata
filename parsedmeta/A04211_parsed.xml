      <title>Anno Domini 1616. A confession and protestation of the faith of certaine Christians in England holding it necessary to observe, &amp; keepe all Christes true substantiall ordinances for his church visible and politicall (that is, indued with power of outward spirituall government) under the gospel; though the same doe differ from the common order of the land. Published for the clearing of the said Christian from the slaunder of schisme, and noveltie, and also of separation, &amp; undutifullness to the magistrate, which their rash adversaries doe falsely cast upon them. Also, an humble petition to the K. Majestie for toleration therein.</title>
