         <title>The Petition of divers gathered churches, and others wel affected, in and about the city of London, for declaring the ordinance of the Lords and Commons, for punishing blasphemies and heresies, null and void. Also, a seasonable premonition to the Churches of God in the countrey, that acknowledge the holy scriptures the only word of faith, and believe that God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not dye, but have everlasting life. More especially to the thirty congregations, whose faith and practise is extant. Printed for William Larner, at the Black-More neer Fleet-Bridge. 1651.</title>
