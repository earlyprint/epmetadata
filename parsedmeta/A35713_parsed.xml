      <note>Attributed by Wing to Charles Stanley, 8th earl of Derby.</note>
      <note>"Derby wrote The Jesuits policy to surpress monarchy, proving out of their own writings that the Protestant religion is a sure foundation and principle of a true Christian.  The same work, ... appeared with the author's name, in 1671, bearing the following title:  "The Protestant religion is a sure foundation and principle of a true Christian, and a good subject ..." 'From the second address to the reader, as well as from the title page of another copy, of the same date, both in the Bodleian Library, we learn that the edition of 1671 is the second one.  Of the title or date of the first edition, or whether or not it was anonymous, nothing has been ascertained." -- cf. Halkett and Laing.  This work is possibly, but not certainly, the first edition.</note>
