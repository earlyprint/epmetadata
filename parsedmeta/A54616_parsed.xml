      <note>"In 1686 the Further observations were prefixed to the Observations upon the Dublin bills as issued in 1683, and the whole was put forward as a 'second edition, corrected and enlarg'd'. In fact, however, the original Observations of 1683 were not even reprinted in 1686, the left-over sheets being utilized, and the only change being the suppression of the 1683 title"--NUC pre-1956.</note>
