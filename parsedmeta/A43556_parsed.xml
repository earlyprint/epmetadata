      <note>An account of conferences and intriguing in Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall from Dec. 1642 to March 1642/3, displaying apprehension lest the agreement between Devon and Cornwall with a view to peace should be upset by Parliamentary intriguers. The account was written between March 15 and March 21 and was no doubt printed about the later date. The style and ornaments prove that it was printed at Oxford. -- Cf. Madan.</note>
