         <title>A declaration from Oxford, of Anne Green a young woman that was lately, and unjustly hanged in the Castle-yard; but since recovered, her neck set strait, and her eyes fixed orderly and firmly in her head again: with her speech touching four angels that appeared to her when she was dead; and their strange expressions, apparations, and passages that happened thereupon, the like never heard of before: being a more full and perfect relation of the great handiwork of God, to the said Anne Green, servant to Sir Tho. Read, who being got with child, and delivered of it in a house of office, dead born, received an unjust sentence to be hanged, and after half an hour, was cut down, and carried to the colledge of physitians, where all the learned doctors and chyrurgions met to anatomize her; but ... she began to stir; ... and after 14. hours, she came to her self, ... Whereunto is annexed another strange wonder from Ashburn in Darbishire, shewing how a young woman dying in child-bed, was buried, and delivered of a young son in the grave</title>
