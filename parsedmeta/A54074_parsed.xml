         <title>A warning of love from the bowels of life, to the several generations of professors of this age that they may awaken and turn towards the life, to be truly cleansed &amp; saved by its powerful living virtue, before the storm of wrath break forth and the over-flowing scourge overtake them, which will sweep away the strongest and most wel-built refuge of lies, and sink those souls (even into the pit of misery) which are there found, when the storm comes : held forth in four propositions, assertions, or considerations concerning man in his lost estate, and his recovery out of it.</title>
