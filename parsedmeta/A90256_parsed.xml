         <title>Ovid's Invective or curse against Ibis, faithfully and familiarly translated into English verse. And the histories therein contained, being in number two hundred and fifty (at the least) briefly explained, one by one; with natural, moral, poetical, political, mathematical, and some few theological applications. Whereunto is prefixed a double index: one of the proper names herein mentioned; another of the common heads from thence deduced. Both pleasant and profitable for each sort, sex and age, and very useful for grammar schools. / By John Jones M.A. teacher of a private school in the city of Hereford.</title>
