         <title>Astrologie theologized: wherein is set forth, vvhat astrologie, and the light of nature is. What influence the starres naturally have on man, and how the same may be diverted and avoided. As also, that the outward man, how eminent soever in all naturall and politicall sciences, is to bee denied, and die in us. And, that the inward man by the light of grace, through profession and practice of a holy life, is to be acknowledged and live in us: which is the onely means to keep the true Sabbath in inward holinesse, and free from outward pollution. / By Valentine Weigelius.</title>
