      <title>In speculo teipsum contemplare Dr. Black. A looking-glass for the black band of doctors VVherein may be seen the ignorance and malice of these physicians, who have clubbed under the name of Dr. Black, for suppressing by their scriblings, and other calumnies, so great a benefite to the world, to the new game of rivers. / Contained in a 2d. letter written by Philander to his friend in the countrey Philomathes. In defence of Dr. Brown.</title>
