         <title>A form of prayer. To be used on Wednesday the 28th of May; being the fast-day appointed by proclamation of the Lord Lieutenant and Council. To seek reconciliation with Almighty God, and to implore him, that he would infatuate, and defeat the counsels of the papists our enemies; continue his mercies and the light of his Gospel to us, and our posterity; and bestow his abundant blessings upon His Sacred Majesty, and this present Parliament.</title>
