         <title>A Full relation, not only of our good successe in generall, but how, and in what manner God hath fought his own cause miraculously, manifesting his mighty power by delivering the Protestants, miserably distressed under a cruell and most inhumane adversary. As also, the names of the chiefe commanders and officers in this late expedition of 3000. foote and 500. horse, under the command of the Earle of Ormond, lieutenant generall, and others mentioned more particularly in the relation. Published to prevent false and erronious copies which too often are set forth with mighty disadvantage to the truth it selfe.</title>
