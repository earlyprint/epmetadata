      <title>News from Darby-shire. Or The wonder of all wonders That ever yet was printed, being a perfect and true relation of the handy work of almighty God shown upon the body of one Martha Taylor now living about a mile or something more from Backwell in Darby shire, hard by a pasture commonly called Hadin pasture, this maid as it hath pleased the Lord, she hath fasted forty weeks and more, which may very well be called a wonder of all wonders, though most people wh[i]ch hear this may censure this to be some fable, yet if they please but to take the pains to read over the book, I hope that they will be better satisfied and have some faith to believe. This maid is still alive and hath a watch set over her by order of the Earl of Devon-shire. Written by me T. Robins. B. of D. a well wisher to the gospel of Iesus Christ. Oct.13.1668</title>
