      <title>A second Christian warning-piece wherein is shewed the first and chief cause of England's present misery, proved to be the chief magistrate's neglect, in not fully doing that work God hath commanded, that must yet be done, because God hath said it, before this nation can expect deliverance. Humbly presented to the Parliament.</title>
