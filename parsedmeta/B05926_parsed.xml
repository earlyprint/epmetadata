This maiden sure was in a longing temper, and young men they are to blame that would venture, it is a pity any damsel she should want the help of a young man's company. This maidens fortune proves so very hard, that never a young does her no more regard: but young men hereafter be sure to have a care, they do not bring young maidens to despair. To the tune of, The country farmer.</title>
