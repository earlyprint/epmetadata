         <title>A friendly discourse concerning profane cursing and swearing, wherein is shewed the heinousness of those sins, and the necessity of private persons giving informations for the suppressing of them, pursuant to the late act of Parliament In a familiar conference between two plain persons. Made publick for the awakening of the consciences of common-swearers; and the vindication of our religious informers, who have been the instruments of the remarkable abatement of swearing; and for the encouragement of all good Christians, to joyn their endeavours with them for the entire suppressing it; and by giving informations to the magistrates against it, drunkenness, and prophanation of the Lord's Day.</title>
