         <title>Strange news indeed: from Mitcham in Surry Of the treacherous and barbarous proceedings, of Master Robert Cranmer merchant of London; against Master Anthonie Sadler, vicar of Mitcham. How that well known minister, for prosecuting that enough known merchant, in a suite at civil law; for the vindication of the churches rights: and for presenting him into the ecclesiastical court; for the vindication of the churches discipline: hath been (of late) defamed, imprisoned, and complotted to be ruined, by him and his party. As, is very briefly, but very truly related, in this letter and petition, to the Lord Bishop of Winton.</title>
