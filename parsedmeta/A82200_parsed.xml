Also a Letter concerning the countries resolutions in relation to the Scots. Decemb. 30. 1647. I approve, ratifie, and confirme these orders of the Councell of Warre, and require all officers and souldiers, of the Army under my command duly to observe the same; and all field officers (in their severall places) to see that they be made known to all under their respective command, as other the Articles and laws of Warre; and to cause them forthwith to be published in every parish church with in the quarters of each troope and company, that they may be the better made known to the country. Given under my hand the 30 of Decemb. 1647. J. Lambert.</title>
