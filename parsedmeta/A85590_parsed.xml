Otherwise, great Charles, our gracious king, eclipsed by the destructive perswasions of his queen, by the pernicious aspects of his cabbinet counsell, and by the subtill insinuations of the Popish faction, priests, Jesuites and others. As also from the firing of towns, the shedding of innocent blood, and the cries of his subjects.</title>
