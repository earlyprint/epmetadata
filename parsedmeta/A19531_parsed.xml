         <note>In 3 parts; "Comfortable and fruitfull meditations on the Lords Prayer" and "Briefe and profitable meditations on the 7. penitentiall psalmes" each have separate dated title pages; register is continuous.</note>
         <note>The catechism, which the Stationer's Register entry indicates was "collected by a poore man" of the Company of Stationers, has a few phrases resembling those in STC 5962 but is so condensed, rearranged, and adapted as to be a different text; it may be related to STC 21496.3. The meditations on the penitential psalmes are taken from G. Du Vair's "M&#233;ditation sur les pseaumes de la p&#233;nitence de David", in a different translation from STC 7373.6. --STC.  Du Vair's M&#233;ditation was published as part of 'La saincte philosophie'.</note>
