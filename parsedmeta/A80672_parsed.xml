      <title>The counter buffe or, Certaine observations upon Mr. Edvvards his animadversions, touching a pamphlet intituled Little Non-such whereby is discernd how passion or spleene may transport some that would be thought great clerks which according to the proverb, doth not alwayes prove the wisest men.  To avoyd all partiality, we will first lay downe Mr. Edwards his own words, touching the three heads he hath culd out of the aforesaid pamphlet, and then our observations upon each shewing (in conclusion) how much hee mistakes the right Independent. If thy minde be busied elsewhere, lay this booke aside till better leysure, it will require privacy and thy best attention.</title>
