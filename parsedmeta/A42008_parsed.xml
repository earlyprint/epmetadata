      <title>A lamentation taken up for London that late flourishing city, a bitter, yea a bitter lamentation over all her inhabitants yet living within and about her borders, and over all her rulers and mighty men, who are fled from her as from a murtherer, with good counsel and advice, from the spirit of the Lord to all, that they may turn unto him before the vials of his wrath be poured out for their utter destruction. By a lover of truth and righteousness: Thomas Greene.</title>
