         <title>A soluntary song, for all stubborn sinners to amend their lives and evil ways. For uncertain is mans life one day for many you see are snatcht away we stand in need then every minute &amp; hour. To pray for Gods grace to give us power to repent our lives and mend our ways we are in great danger in these days. If death do come and we be unprepar'd, there will be then a bad reward; therefore we had need to watch and pray that our sins they may be all washt away; there's but one way that we can have, there's no repentance in the grave. To the tune of The sinners redemption.</title>
