      <title>A voyce from the temple. The word of God, the covenant of light, doth discover and declare the Anabaptist so called, to be in the reprobate state, and one of those many heads and horns of the beast which are sprung out of the beast, since the time of the comming in of the apostacie, when the churches backslided and became apostated, from the true faith. And these have got the true prophets words, but are out of the true prophets life; and these have got Christs words, and the apostles; and for matter of the outward forme, as dipping, and breaking of bread; but are open opposers of the light and spirit by which the apostles were led and guided ... Written and published to goe abroad in the army among those that are called Anabaptists: by ... Jonas Dell.</title>
