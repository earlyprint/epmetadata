      <title>The naked truth laid open, against vvhat is amiss: or, may be mis-interpreted, in those two bookes: the one, entituled, The foot out of the snare; and the other, The snare broken. Together with a word of invitation to all who are estranged to the true faith, that they would hear and receive the word of truth, which makes free the Israel of God. / Set forth by me John Toldervy.</title>
