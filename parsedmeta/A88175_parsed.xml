      <title>Love's advocate, or Certain arguments tendred to the serious consideration of all that truly fear God, either in Parliament or Army, concerning M. Christopher Love minister, now a condemned prisoner in the Tower, for the utter repealing, or at least the moderating that sad sentence under which he now lyeth. With clear satisfaction to all contrary scruples to unbyassed spirits. / By a faithfull friend to the Parliament, one who never yet declined their cause to the right or left, but hath continued in their service from the beginning of their troubles to this very day.</title>
