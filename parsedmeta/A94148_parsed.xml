         <title>The Swedish cloak of religion: or, A politick discourse between two citizens of Elbing. Occasioned by the publishing of a proclamation, by the Swedish governour of that city. Wherein is laid open to the view of the world, how the whole palatinate of Marienburgh in Prussia is made desolate, and brought into slavery, by the Swedish religious pretexts, and introduction of a new church-government. And consequently, the grand mistake of all such as have conceived an impression that the present King of Swedens martial undertakings were really intended for or towards the propagation and defence of the Protestant cause. First printed in the German language, and now faithfully Englished.</title>
