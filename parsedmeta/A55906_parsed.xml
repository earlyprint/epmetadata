      <note>Caption title.</note>
      <note>The ode differs considerably from the version given in Prior's "Poems on several occasions" 1709, under the amended title "Hymn to the sun." But the text is identical with that which appears in v. 4 of Dryden's "Miscellanies," where the poem was first reprinted.</note>
