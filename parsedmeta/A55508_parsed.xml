         <title>A posing-book for scholars in short questions and answers. Containing a mixture of several things not commonly known among the meaner sort; and yet of great usefulness for all to understand that are willing to be scholars. Being only a rude essay, by a lover of learning, who intends (God permitting, and the inhabitants of England accepting) not only to make this more compleat, but also to prepare by degrees such helps for learning so far as concerns English, that none shall have cause more to complain for want of it: but the slothful, and wilfully ignorant. With allowance.</title>
