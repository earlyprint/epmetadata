      <title>A warning to London in particular wherein the wickedness thereof is reproved, and the people put in mind of some of the sore distresses and great calamities, that God already hath brought upon that formerly florishing and happy city : also the future distress and calamities hinted at, which God will bring upon the inhabitants thereof, that come not in their day to cease to do evil, and by timely repentance, turn to the Lord, while He calls, and His Spirit yet strives with them.</title>
