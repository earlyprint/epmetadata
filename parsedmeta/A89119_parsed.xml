      <title>The spovse rejoycing over antichrist, and triumphing over the devill, in the day of the Lord, when God alone shal bee exalted. Written in the day and yeer, when the world is running besides it self, crying out against truth, in the hearing of truth; this mad world is beside it self, persecuting those which desire not to meddle with the world: I have found it, that the world cannot indure light, my experience makes it manifest. / Written by James Michel, who have been lately accused for blasphemy in the words which is Scripture; they say that this is blasphemy which the Scripture faith, My God, my God is a consuming fire, and everlasting burning: to this I shal rest to the proceeding further in the book.</title>
