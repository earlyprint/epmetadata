      <note>Contains twenty sermons. At the beginning of the eighteenth sermon (folio xxlxxix) Edgeworth states that he had abstained from preaching for five or six years, viz. during the reign of King Edward VI; consequently the former sermons were delivered in King Henry VIII's time and the rest after Queen Mary's accession--DNB.</note>
