         <title>A loving salutation to the seed of Abraham among the Jewes: where ever they are scattered up and down upon the face of the earth. And to the seed of Abraham among all people upon the face of the earth; which are all out of the way ... And the way of truth opened to them, which is the way of holinesse ... where the uncleane cannot passe, bnt [sic] is for the ransomed and redeemed to returne to Zion ... Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer ... By M.F.</title>
