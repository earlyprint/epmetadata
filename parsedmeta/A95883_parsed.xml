         <title>Dagon demolished: or, Twenty admirable examples of Gods severe justice and displeasure against the subscribers of the late engagement, against our lawfull soveraign King Charls the second; and the whole House of Peeres, in these words. I do declare and promise, that I will be true and faithfull to the common-wealth of England, as it is now established without a King or House of Lords. Also against some of the judges of the late King in the high court of injustice. Published, to reclaim such fanatique persons, who have been too forward to promote this wicked, destructive engagement; and still designe it, which hath wounded the consciences of so many Godly Christians in this kingdome. By that late worthy patriot of his country, Mr. John Vicars.</title>
