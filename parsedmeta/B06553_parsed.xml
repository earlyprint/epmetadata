      <title>A sober reply to Mr Robert Steed's epistle concerning singing. Wherein all his objections against that way he calls the common and popular way of singing psalms, &amp;c. are impartially examined, and in the spirit of meekness, fully answered. Recommended to the consideration of all the saints and churches of Christ, by divers elders and ministers of baptized congregations. Who desire their brethren who are against such singing, without prejudice to read these lines, and consider them.</title>
