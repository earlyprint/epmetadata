All which ought seriously and sadly to be laid to heart, 1. Some of them by all in generall, in whom there is any honesty, as men, loyalty, as subiects, piety, as Christians. 2. Some other of them by Presbyterians in speciall. 3. Other some by those that are to joyn in the counsel in particular. Collected by him that is a lover of truth, loyalty, and the subiects liberty, both for his own, and others better satisfaction. / By S.L. minister of the gospel.</title>
