         <title>Englands out-cry, for the sad distractions now lying upon the church and state. Wherein shee humbly implores mercy from God, pitty from her soveraigne, and justice on her enemies. Laying downe, both the primary, and secondary causes, of her fresh bleeding calamities. So that judicious, simple, all may see, the first promoter of this misery. Reade diligently, consider carefully, and make what thou hast read, a case of conscience. VVritten by J. Harris. This is licensed, and entered, according to order</title>
