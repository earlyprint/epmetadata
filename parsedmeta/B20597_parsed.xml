      <title>A computation of what a tax laid only on shooes, boots, slippers and gloves may amount unto in a year: whereby it is made appear it will bring more mony into the exchequer, and be a less tax on the subject, of as little charge and trouble to collect, and the poor not so liable to be oppress'd by it as by a general tax on leather. All which is humbly submitted to the consideration of both houses of Parliament.</title>
