      <title>The sons of the east: being an epistle written in English by old Dr. Chamberlen (eldest scarlet of Europe) senior to all popes, cardinals, bishops, and doctors, now living.) To the synagogue of the Jews in London, being a remnant of the numerous people of Israel, scattered into all countries over the face of the earth; who were once the peculiar inheritance, and only beloved people (above the nations of the world) wisheth health, grace, and truth, from God the father of all, by the means of the true Messiah; whose coming Israel expects on earth, and Christians hope from heaven in glory. Amen.</title>
