      <title>Bellum Hybernicale: or, Ireland's vvarre astrologically demonstrated, from the late celestiall-congresse of the two malevolent planets, Saturne and Mars, in Taurus, the ascendent of that kingdome. VVherein likewise, their future opposition in the signs Sagittary and Gemini, (most ominous to London, and many other of the south and west parts of England) is mathematically handled. The ignorance, malice, mistakes, errors, insolencies, and impertinencies, of Iohn Booker, (in his astrologicall observations upon the said conjunction, in a late pamphlet of his, styled, A bloody Irish almanack, &amp;c.) discovered, corrected, refuted, and retorted: and the author further vindicated, from his, and Master Lilly's former frivolous, false, and malicious aspersions, throughout the whole discourse. / By Capt. Geo: Wharton, student in astronomy.</title>
