         <title>A confession and profession of faith in God: by his people who are inscorn [sic] called Quakers. Also shewing that the people of God are no vagabonds, nor idle, dissolute persons, nor Jesuites, though they wander up and down, and pass from one country to another, and from one nation to another, as they are moved of the Lord in his service. And this is to clear the truth from all false aspersions. By R. Farnsvvorth.</title>
