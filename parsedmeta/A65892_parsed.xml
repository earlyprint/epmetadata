      <title>The true ministers living of the Gospel, distinguished from the false ministers living upon tithes and forced maintenance.  With a word of reproof (preceding the distinction) to the ministers of the nation, whose kingdom is already shaken and divided against itself.  And the iniquity and antichristianism of that ministry which is upheld by forced maintenance, briefly discovered according to the scriptures of the Old and New Testament.  In a brief reply to a book stiled, An answer to a Quakers seventeen heads of quaeries, by John Bewick, who calls himself a minister of the Gospel, and rector of the parish church of Stanhop in Weredale in the county of Durham.</title>
