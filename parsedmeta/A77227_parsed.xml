         <title>The Quakers quaking principles examined and refuted in a briefe answer to some erroneous tenets held forth by James Naylor in his answers unto Mr Baxter, and some others that have publikely opposed that blacke spirit in the deluded Quakers. Wherein is also included a serious admonition, how wee ought to behave our selves towards the ministers of the gospell, in respect of communicating unto them; and for giving to the poore, so as the Gospell requires: and to beware of covetousnesse, and the effects thereof, least wee be left of God, and delivered up unto strong delusions, and a blasphemous spirit instead of the spirit of God. The heads of the whole discourse are also premised. / Written by Ellis Bradshavve.</title>
