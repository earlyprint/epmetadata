         <title>A treatise of the asthma divided into four parts : in the first is given a history of the fits, and the symptoms preceding them : in the second, the cacochymia which disposes to the fit, and the rarefaction of the spirits which produces it, are described : in the third, the accident causes of the fit, and the  symptomatic asthmas are observed :  in the fourth, the cure of the asthmas fit, and the method of preventing it is proposed : to which is annext a digression about the several species of acids distinguish'd by their tastes, and 'tis observ'd how far they were thought convenient or injurious in general practice by the old writers, and most particularly in relation to the care of the asthma.</title>
