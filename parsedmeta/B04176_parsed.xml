         <title>A looking-glass for ladies, or, A mirrour for married-women. Lively setting forth the rare constancy, chastity, patience, and purity of Penelope the wife of Ulisses, one of the Grecian generals, who during the ten years absence of her husband at the siege of Troy, was solicited, and importun'd, by numbers of emminent suitors; who attempted her chastity, and endeavoured to violate her honour, but never could prevail. She addicted her self wholly to charity, and good housewifery, until her husbands return. Which may serve as a pattern for all ladies, gentlewomen, and others to imitate her vertuous example. Tune of, Queen Dido: or, Troy town. With allowance.</title>
