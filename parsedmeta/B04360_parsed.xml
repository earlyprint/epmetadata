      <title>The dub'd knight of the Forked order. Or, The old wanton lady as I will recite, and Sen John the serving-man her hearts delight, their doings and actions, if you will attend, in meeter, they are by a poet pen'd. The subitlity of women either old or young, and what cunning excuses they have with their tongue. That will play with their husbands and laugh them to scorn, stroke up there brows, and there place a horn.  The tune is, I am fallen away.</title>
