         <title>The righteousnes of God to man, wherein he was created; with a discovery of the fall, by the strength and subtilty of the serpent: and of the recovery of man, by the seed of the woman, which bruises the serpents head. Also, a declaration against the beast and his followers, who act by his power; and a warning to the people not to joyn with the beast, nor to uphold the harlot, least you be taken with the beast and the false prophet, and cast into the lake together alive, and there be none to deliver you. A few words to O. C. and to the officiers and souldiers of the army in general. With, a true declaration how I lived before I knew the truth, and how I came to know the truth, and overcame deceit. Given forth for the simples sake, that they may learn righteousness; ... / By a sufferer for the righteous seed sake, in the common goal of Edmonds Bury in Suffolk, who is called George Rofe.</title>
