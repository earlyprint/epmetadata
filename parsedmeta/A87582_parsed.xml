         <title>Jesuites plots and counsels plainly discovered to the most unlearned: which hath satisfied many about these present distractions. VVherein is laid open the Jesuites endeavours to bring all states to monarchies, and all the commons in monarchies to slavery, and how they have been put on foot here in England. Also how their counsels brought Germany into these long and bloudy wars, and endeavoured to bring Poland into slavery.</title>
