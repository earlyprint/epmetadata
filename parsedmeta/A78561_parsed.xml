         <title>A tender salutation: or, loving epistle to such, who have a breathing in the innocent life of my friends with whom I walked in the outward observances. Also, for my relations (after the flesh) with all others professing God, and that have any breathings after the truth in the inward parts. Wherein something is declared in the power and light of God, concerning the sure foundation, and the house of God, with the inward glory, government, cloathing, feeding, non-superiority, and safety, that is in Gods habitation. With a word to the weak to establish them, that they faint not at the appearances of outward trouble for their consciences. - Whereunto is annexed a further discovery of God to my soul, concerning the spiritual temple, tabernacle and ark of Gods testimony, being the truth, life, and substance of the temple, tabernacle and ark of the testimony under the legal day. - To be read in the light, which discovers the things that be of God. -</title>
