By which appeareth, that the free-men of the Citie of London have their liberty to chuse yearly, or oftner (if need be) a major, two sheriffs, four treasurers, two bridge-masters, chamberlane, common clark, common sergeant, of the city aforesaid, and to remove them at pleasure. That the free-men of wards have a right, yearly to chuse their aldermen, and that the same aldermen are not to bee chosen the next yeere. These and many other particulars of the long concealed rights of the free-men of London, will most evidently appear in the ensuing relation.</title>
