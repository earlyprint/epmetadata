         <title>The muzled ox, treading out the corn, and bellowing out his just complaint against his merciless masters. Or, A loud cry from heaven, against the crying sin of this nation, viz. the with-holding competent countenance and maintenance from Gospel ministers; to the high dishonor of God, and the grief of all truly godly. Wherein is laid down first, the several causes, secondly the sad consequences of this grand and Gospel grievance. Thirdly, solutions to all contrary cavils and scruples. Fourthly, remedies for future prevention. Fiftly, several motives to ministerial encouragement. / By a friend to the threshing floor of Ornan, aut Ecclesi&#230; Dei.</title>
