      <title>A copie of the Kings message sent by the Duke of Lenox. Also the copie of a petition to the King from the inhabitants of Somersetshire, to come with him to the Parliament. A declaration by the committee of Dorsetshire, against the Cavaliers in those parts; declaring how sixe French papists ravished a woman one after another: she having been but three dayes before delivered out of child-bed. Also, how a gentleman at Oxford was cruelly tortured in irons, and for what they were so cruell towards him. And how they would have burnt down an ale-house at the Brill, because the woman refused farthing tokens; and other cruelties of the Cavaliers, manifested to the kingdome. Published according to order of Parliament.</title>
