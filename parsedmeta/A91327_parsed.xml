         <title>Of a free trade. A discourse seriously recommending to our nation the wonderfull benefits of trade, especially of a rightly governed, and ordered trade. Setting forth also most clearly, the relative nature, degrees, and qualifications of libertie, which is ever to be inlarged, or restrained according to that good, which it relates to, as that is more, or lesse ample. / Written by Henry Parker Esquire.</title>
