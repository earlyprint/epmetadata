         <title>Whereas we are informed, that the price of corn, and all sorts of grain and meal, is grown excessive great in severall parts of this kingdom, and the same doth arise (as is conceived) not so much from the scarcity of the store, as from the great quantities of corn that have been of late carried out of this countrey into foreign parts, and also from the ill disposed minds of the countrey-farmers and corn-masters at home ... by the Lord Lieutenant and Council, Essex.</title>
