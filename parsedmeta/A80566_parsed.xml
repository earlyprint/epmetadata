      <title>Cordiall councell, in a patheticall epistle: first written to an eminent professor of religion, for the seasonable preventing of a relaps. Which proving efficacious, is again revised, enlarged, and published for the good of others. As being applyable to many thousands, whose practise is neither answerable to the Gospel, their Christian profession, nor the millions of mercies they have received. By R. Junius.</title>
