      <title>The Army --- armed, and their just powers stated: or Arguments unansvverable; proving them just and lawfull powers; and governours, and so not usurpers. Likewise a justification of this present Parliament, and Councel of State chosen, and constituted by them for authentique and lawful powers, and governours also, against all opposers whatsoever, conceived usefull for satisfying any one of the said powers scrupulous amongst themselves, so any other conscientious people whatsoever. And lastly, to be even with all sorts of cunning and politique pretenders against any of them, as not lawfull powers and governors, on purpose to countenance disobedience and rebellion, and so raise factions, to the disturbance and endangering of our country. Written immediately upon the dissolution of the late Parliament, and the creation of our new one, but occasionally reserv'd till now. By S.H. Senior.</title>
