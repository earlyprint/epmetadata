         <note>Variant: with title page and A3v partly in a different setting, and A4 in a completely different setting. On the title page, the words "With the names .. counties." are replaced with "With two orders made by both Houses of Parliament: June 2. 1642. H. Elsynge Cler. Parl. D.C.". A4 bears the two orders of Parliament rather than the King's proclamation.</note>
