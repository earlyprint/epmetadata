      <title>England know thy drivers, and their driver: or, Democritus natu minimus laughing at the epidemical phrensie of his own nation being so overwhelmed in iniquity, and stupidity, and so hoodwinked by the snares, and slights of its artificial, and pernitious drivers, that it discerneth not in their subtile machinations the indignation of the cheif [sic], omniscient, and omnipotent driver. Whereby England may bee advertised to avoid, and beat back the smart-lash of some of those drivers upon themselves, to whom it is most proper, and thereby may appease the wrath of the cheif [sic] driver.</title>
