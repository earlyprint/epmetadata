      <title>Westrow revived. A funerall poem without fiction. / Composed by Geo: Wither Esq. That God may be glorified in his saints; that the memory of Thomas Westrow Esq; may be preserved, and that others by his exemplary life and death may be drawn to imitation of his vertues. Blest are the dead who dye in Christ; for, from their labours they do rest; and, whether they do live or dye, his saints are precious in his eye.</title>
