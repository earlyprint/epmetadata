         <title>Adam unvailed, and seen with open face or, Israel's right way from Egypt to Canaan, lately discovered. Wherein his estate is laid down, opened and compared with ours, under severall dispensations; in opposition to what ever hath been formerly declared by most men: in which many excellent truths appear, to the great comfort and consolation of all those that are made capable of it.
