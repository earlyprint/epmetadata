By a servant and messenger of the Lord, who is called into the work of the Lord, and to blow his trumpet in England; so that all may be forwarned in this day of the Lords calm, and be left without excuse, and in the day of his righteous judgments be found just and true; in love to all imprisoned souls. / By a lover of all souls, who is called, James Parnel.</title>
