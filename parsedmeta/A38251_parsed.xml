      <note>"Despite the title, this collection is not one of the series of 12 published by Richard Janeway and reissued in 1689 with general title: A compleat collection of papers in twelve parts ... An advertisement on verso of t.p. of Janeway's 6th collection warns of spurious 6th and 7th collections published by R. Baldwin; the present collection is another item in Baldwin's series. 'An account of several papers that have been collected' (caption title, p. 33-34) lists the contents of Janeway's first 5 collections and Baldwin's collections 6-8, implying that all were issued as parts of the same series"--NUC pre-1956 imprints.</note>
