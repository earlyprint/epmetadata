      <title>The accusation given by His Maiestie against the Lord Wilmot: together with the Lord Wilmots declaration of his innocency. Also a petition of the officers of the old horse to His Maiesty, in behalfe of the Lord VVilmot: with his Maiesties answer thereunto. By which it is most evident, that the Lord Wilmot is in great danger of losing his head, (if hee hath not lost it already, as some affirme) for being a suiter to his Maiesty for peace; and for being averse to the proceedings of Prince Rupert, shewing a just dislike that he, being the grand favourer of the Irish rebels should be so much countenanced, and entrusted by his Majesty with so great a power.
