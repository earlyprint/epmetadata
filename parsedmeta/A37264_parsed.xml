         <title>A vindication of the doctrine of justification and union before faith wherein the great truth of the grace of Our Lord Jesus in his representing the person of his elect on the cross, of his suffering for them as their representative is asserted and cleared, and the eternal justification and union of the Lord's chosen people is plainly stated and proved : also the assurance of faith is evidently confirmed : with a clear demonstraction how these precious Gospel truths do promote holiness and sanctification in the hearts and conversations of true believers / by R. Davis.</title>
