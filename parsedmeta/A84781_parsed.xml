         <title>A declaration of the ground of error &amp; errors, blasphemy, blasphemers, and blasphemies; and the ground of inchantings and seducing spirits, and the doctrine of devils, the sons of sorcerers, and the seed of the adulterer, and the ground of nicromancy, which doth defile witches and wizards. How this is all from the spirit of God in the transgression of it; and all them that draw from the spirit of God, draw into it; and they that are lead by the spirit of God, are led from it to God, and to the knowledge of the doctrine of Christ. By G. F.</title>
