      <title>The trepan: being a true relation, full of stupendious variety, of the strange practises of Mehetabel the wife of Edward Jones, and Elizabeth wife of Lieutenant John Pigeon, sister to the said Mehetabel. Wherein is discovered the subtil method whereby they cheated Mr. Wessel Goodwin, a dyar in Southwark, and all his children of a fair estate: with sundry copies of letters, perfumed locks of hair, and verses they sent him, and many other notable devices belonging to the art of trepanning.</title>
