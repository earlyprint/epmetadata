Wherein is shewed her great and unparallell'd sufferings on the account of her said conversion; as also her wonderful deliverance from two assassines hired by a popish priest to murther her: and of her miraculous preservation in a wood for two years; and how she was at last providentially found by her husband, who (together with her parents) was brought over by her means to the embracing of the true religion, as were divers others also. To which is added, a brief account of the present severe persecutions of the French Protestant.</title>
