         <note>(from t.p.) The queries: I. Concerning the original of government. II. What is the constitution of the government of England? III. What obligation lies on the King by the Coronation-Oath? IV. What obligation lies on the subject by the Oaths of Supremacy, &amp;c. V. Whether if the King violate his oath, and actually destroys the ends of it, the subjects are freed from their obligation to him? VI. Whether the King hath renounced or deserted the government? VII. Whether on such desertion the people, to preserve themselves from confusion, may admit another, and what method is to be used in such admission? VIII. Whether the settlement now made, is a lawful establishment, and such as with a good conscience may be submitted to?</note>
