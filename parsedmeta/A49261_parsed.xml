         <title>A vindication of Mr. Christopher Love from divers scandalous reproaches cast upon him by the malignant party. Who charge him to be a hinderer of the Treaty at Uxbridge, and a disturber of the peace of this Common-wealth. Wherein he cleereth himself from those aspersions; and sheweth that he alwayes constantly endeavoured that peace with truth might be established; to the glory of God, and the comfort of this nation. Written with his own hand, before his death, and now published for general satisfaction.</title>
