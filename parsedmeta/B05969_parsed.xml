Death, which is most certain, judgment, which is most strict, hell, which is most dismal; heaven, which is most delightfull. To which is added wholsome instructions both to young and old, in order to prepare themselves for their latter end, and avoid all sinful allurements, which usually obstructs that great and necessary work of salvation. With some necessary directions to die well, in order to avoid hell, and obtain heaven. / By Mr. J. Stevens.</title>
