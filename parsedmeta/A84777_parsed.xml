         <title>A declaration against all profession and professors that have not the life of what they profess, from the righteous seed of God; whom the world, priests, and people scornfully calls Quakers, who are in that life that the holy men of God were in, and witness that power that made them to tremble and quake, and shook the earth, and threw it down; which the world, priests, people, and professors, having the words declared from this power and life, but not it, scoffs and scorns at, but this is our riches.</title>
