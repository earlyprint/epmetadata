         <title>To the present authority of Parliament now sitting, and to all other rulers and officers belonging to this nation of England, who now bears chiefest rule. Some words of reflection to you all, touching those who bear rule before you, whom the Lord hath justly put down from their seats ... but this chiefly to you who are the present rulers [to] put you in minde of the cry of the neglect of the righteous; also to yourselves a warning and true admonition. / [by] Bryan Wilkinson.</title>
