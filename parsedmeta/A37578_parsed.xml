         <title>The land of promise and the covenant thereof explained by certaine questions and propositions propounded to those that teach a deliverance of the Iewes out of all countries to the land of Canaan : and from their long continued blindnesse to the faith of Christ : and a glorious estate in the land for a thousand years : and also to those that teach a personall comming of Christ and a resurrection of the just to live and raigne with Christ a thousand yeares before the resurrection of the uniust and end of the world : of which there bee severall sorts, who are commonlyl called millinaries : by which doctrine of each of these the true intent of sundry places of Scripture of great importance to the church and people of Godm [sic] is uch [sic] obscured which being rightly understood and taught acording to their true and playne meaning would be greatly to the edification and comfort of Gods chosen, especially now in these last dayes wherein the accomplishment of all things which God hath spoken, draweth so nigh.</title>
