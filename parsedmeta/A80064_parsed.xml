         <title>Colchesters teares: affecting and afflicting city and country; dropping from the sad face of a new warr, threatning to bury in her own ashes that wofull tovvn. Faithfully collected, drawn out into a moderate relation and debate, humbly presented to all free-born Englishmen; by severall persons of quality. Who much doubted and desired to see the truth in the mist of various relations obscuring the same, but now convinced by their own eyes, doe conceive themselves bound to give out this brief narrative, to satisfie all unprepossessed civil and moderate men, and good Christians, who truly love Jesus Christ, their King, city, and countrey, and sincerely desire the settlement of peace and truth.</title>
