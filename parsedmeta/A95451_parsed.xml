         <title>Two most strange wonders; the one is a true relation of an angel appearing to Mr James Wise minister in York-shire, and the many strange and wonderful visions which he at that time beheld; as also his prophecies concerning some years of plenty, and a great dearth presently afterwards to ensue; with the burning and utter destruction of many goodly towns and countries. The other being a most fearful judgment which befell Dorothy Matley of Ashover in the County of Derby on Saturday the 23. of March last, who having couzened a poor lad of two single pence, wish't that the ground might bury her alive if she had it, which presently came to pass, for the ground opened and swallowed her and the tub she washed lead-ore in. The truth of this wonder is here incerted by Mr. Iddolls minister; Tho. Riche, Henry Wapping kinsman to her, Giles VVinter, Tho. Smith, Francis Brown and many others.</title>
