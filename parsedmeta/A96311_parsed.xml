         <title>A sad relation of the miseries of the province of Munster in the realm of Ireland: signified by letters written from thence very lately, by a gentleman of good credit, to his brother here in London. By which it doth appear, in what imminent danger that province now is for to be lost, and how numerous the rebels now are there gathered together in their siege of Youghall, with a discovery of their barbarous and cruell usage to those English they take prisoners.</title>
