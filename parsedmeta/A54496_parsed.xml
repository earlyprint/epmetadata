         <title>A philosophical account of this hard frost From whence is rationally concluded what effects it may probably have upon humane bodies, as to health and sickness. Both in relation to the time of the frosts continuance, and to the time of thaw that shall succeed. With cautionary directions for the prevention of such distempers as are likely to be the natural consequence of both those seasons. Which directions are not only calculated for this present season, but are designedly adapted to serve upon the like occasion for time to come. Written in answer to a letter of a person of quality, and at his command made publick for the common good. By John Peter physician.</title>
