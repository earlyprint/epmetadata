         <title>The contented cuckold, or Patience upon force is a medcine [sic] for a mad man. You batchellors both young and old give ear unto this ditty, a story here I will unfold in mirth I hope it will ... ye, a batchellor of three score years a damsel young did marry now he complains she doth him wrong and basely doth miscarry. Near Worksworth town in Darby-shire this couple they do dwell, with patience pray this ditty hear and then I bid farewell. To the tune, She cannot hold her legs together.</title>
