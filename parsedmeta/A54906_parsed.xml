         <title>Bowells of compassion towards the fettered seed. Or a visitation to all, who hath been seeking the resting place, but hath not found it the cause why shewed, and the way to it manifested, wherein is something shewed also, of the emptinesse, and unsoundnesse of all profession, without the light of Christ, to be the guide. Also an information to all the honest-hearted who desires to know the truth in the simplicity of it concerning us, the people of the most high who is by the world called Quakers: ... Written in love to the scattered people in America: and is to be sent to all the islands belonging to it, that all may be warned, and left without excuse. By one who am a witnesse what the Lord hath done for his people, and hath obteined with him among the rest of the faithfull, whom he hath gathered into his fold of rest; where they are throughly satisfied; and lies down in peace and rest.
