      <title>The troublesome life and raigne of King Henry the Third. Wherein five distempers and maladies are set forth. Viz. 1. By the Pope and church-mens extortions. 2. By the places of best trust bestowed upon unworthy members. 3. By patents and monopolies for private favourites. 4. By needlesse expences and pawning of jewels. 5. By factious Lords and ambitious peeres. Sutable to these unhappie times of ours; and continued with them till the King tied his actions to the rules of his great and good councell, and not to passionate and single advice.</title>
