         <title>Doctor Lambs darling: or, strange and terrible news from Salisbury; being a true, exact, and perfect relation, of the great and wonderful contract and engagement made between the devil, and Mistris Anne Bodenham; with the manner how she could transform her self into the shape of a mastive dog, a black lyon, a white bear, a woolf, a bull, and an cat; and by her charms and spels, send either man or woman 40 miles an hour in the ayr. The tryal, examination, and confession of the said mistris Bodenham, before the Lord chief Baron Wild, &amp; the sentence of death pronounc'd against her, for bewitching of An Stiles, and forcing her to write her name in the devils book with her own blood; so that sometimes the devil appearing all in black without a head, renting her cloaths, tearing her skin, and tossing her up and down the chamber, to the great astonishment of the spectators. Appointed to be printed and published, as a caveat and warning piece for England, Scotland, and Ireland. James Bower, Cleric.</title>
