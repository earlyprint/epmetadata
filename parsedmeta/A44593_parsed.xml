         <title>Sighs from Hell: or, The groans of the damned Delivered in a sermon from the parable of Dives and Lazarus. Wherein is plainly set forth the miserable state of those that like Dives have their good things in this life, but after this life is ended go down to Hell, and there being in torment cry for a drop of water to cool their tongue. Being preached, and now made publique on purpose to awaken the carnal besotted sinners of England. Also a word of comfort to all the poor afflicted people of God, who in this life time receives evil things, but in the world to come joys unspeakable, and life everlasting. By R. Hough, minister of the gospel.</title>
