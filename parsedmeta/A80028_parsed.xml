      <title>Divine blossomes. A prospect or looking-glass for youth: wherein and whereby he may plainly behold and see a supereminency and super-excellency of grace and religion, beyond the worlds honor, glory, fame, repute, pleasure, joy, delight, love,. [sic] And all other lower accomodations whatsoever. Laid down to youth by exciting parallel between [brace] earths honor carnal pleasure inordinate love [brace] and [brace] heavens glory  and spiritual pleasure divine love. Under every of which particulars, the author exemplarily expresseth himself in a varied verse. / Composed by a hearty wel-wisher to the youthful generation, Francis Cockin, alias Cokayne.</title>
