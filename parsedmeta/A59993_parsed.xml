         <note>Writtten by James Shirley, not by Anthony Rivers. Cf. DNB; NUC pre-1956.</note>
         <note>Licensed as by Shirely and printed in 1635 under his name.  Motteux (1692) ascribed the work to the Jesuit Rivers (d. 1626); but Gillow thinks Anthony Rivers, "vere Whitelock," who died in Newgate after 1635 more probable.  The ascription to Rivers is discredited by Dyce and others.  Cf. J. Gillow, Biog. dict. of English Catholics, v. 5, p. 428-429; A.H. Nason, James Shirley, 1915, p. 432.</note>
