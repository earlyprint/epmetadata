      <title>Emanuel, or, God with us. Wherein is set forth Englands late great victory over the Scots armie, in a battle at Dunbar, Septemb. 3. 1650. And by many particulars of Gods acting and appearing then for us, it is certaine (and so much is clearly proved) that our armies marching into Scotland, and the wars undertaken and prosecuted against that nation, to be upon grounds of justice and necessity, as the Parliament of England hath declared. Also here is shewed, how grosly the Covenant is abus'd, and what an idoll it is now made. With the fraud and falshood of the Scots, and their kings hypocrisie and dissimulation. Moreover such objections are answered, as seeme to have any thing in them, against the point here asserted. / By John Canne. The first part, published by authority.</title>
