         <title>A pill to purge melancholy: or merry newes from Newgate: wherein is set forth, the pleasant jests, witty conceits, and excellent couzenages, of Captain James Hind, and his associates. How Hind, putting on a bears skin, attempted to rob a committeeman at Oxford of 200 l. and how he had like to have been worried by a mastiff dog; and what means he used to free himself from the fury of the mastiff, and afterwards got the money. How Hind cheated an excize-man of his mare, which was esteemed one of the best in England; and being afterwards apprehended for her at Newark, how neatly he made his escape, and got the mare again. How Hind disguising himself in womens apparel, gul'd an old lawyer in the temple of 14 l. shewing him such a trick in the law, that he never knew before. How Hind having knowledge that the old lawyer had 100 l. more in his trunk which stood in his chamber, devised a way to get that also; and how he was serv'd by a gentleman of the temple, who new christen'd him. With a variety of other delightfull passages, never heretofore published by any pen.</title>
