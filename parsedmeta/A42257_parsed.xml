         <note>" ... [Rycaut] had a very slight knowledge of the Spanish language and he did not scruple to make wild guesses at the meaning of sentences, and to omit whole chapters. Thus he only gives fourteen out of the twenty-six chapters in the first book, and sixteen out of the twenty-six in the second."--C.S. Markham's introd. to the First part of the Royal commentaries, 1869-71, v. 1, p. xvi.</note>
