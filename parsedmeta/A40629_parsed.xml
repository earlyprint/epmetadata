      <title>The turtle-dove, under the absence &amp; presence of her only choise, or, Desertion &amp; deliverance revived 1. Ushered with the Nicodemian paradox explained in a comparison between the first and second birth, and closed with the characters of the old and new man, 2. And seconded with a surveyof the first and second death, which is closed with a sepation [sic]-kisse between two most intimate friends, the soul and body of man, 3. And a glimring of the first and second resurrection and generall judgement : closing with a song of degrees, from what we were to what we are, and from thence toward what we will be / by a lover of the celestiall muses.</title>
