      <title>The fallibility &amp; falsehood of the Church of Rome briefly detected and made manifest, both in several instances thereof, and in the Scripture assertion thereabout. Together vvith some reasons of so many retaining or returning to communion with her, notwithstanding so many and clear discoveries of her falshood, and the great danger of everlasting destruction: that such persons, especially that after seperation from her, return to her communion, do rush themselves upon. VVritten for the preservation of such as are under any temptation, to turn aside unto her; and for the recalling and reclaiming such as have been or are seduced by her. By way of letter to a friend.</title>
