         <title>A proper project for Scotland To startle fools, and frighten knaves, but to make wise-men happy. Being a safe and easy rememdy to cure our fears, and ease our minds, with the undoubted causes of God's wrath, and of the present national calamities. By a person neither unreasonably Cameronian, nor excessively Laodicean, and idolizer of moderation; but, entre deus, avoiding extreams, on either hand: that is, a good, honest, sound Presyterian, a throw-pac'd, true-blue Loyalist; for God, King, and countrey: and why not for Co-----t too?</title>
