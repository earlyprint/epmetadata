      <title>Novum lumen chirurgicum extinctum, or, Med. Colbatch's New light of chirurgery put out Wherein the dangerous and uncertain woundcuring of the pretending med. and the base imposture of his quack medicines, are impartially examin'd, describ'd, and evidently confuted and the method and medicines formerly receiv'd, and successfully practis'd, are rationally vindicated from the calumnies of his ignorant and malicious aspersions. : His experiments which he mentions, convicted of falshood; and others what their miscarriages are, annex'd; which he had craftily and knowingly suppress'd. / By W.W. surgeon.</title>
