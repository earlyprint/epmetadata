         <title>An instruction to judges &amp; lawyers, that they may act and judge as the judges did of old, and that they may see how they are degenerated from them that judged at the first, and that in reading this thorow, they may see what hath been lost, and how they may be resotored by the power of the Lord ... And how people have bin put to death for that which they should have restored, or been sold for their theft; ... And concerning the poor mans cry, who know his matter and business himself, and is able to speak to it ... Given forth to the intent men might consider these things, and come to the life of God, and live at the first, that justice might run down, and truth and righteousnesse may be set up. G.F.</title>
