      <title>Power and government made forth by God in scripture by a rule of righteousnesse: by which rule shal all the actions of men be judged at the last day. 1. Made forth by God to the people of Israel in the Old Testament. 2. By Christ in the New Testament, to future generations. Wherein is expresly set forth, the difference of that power and government which is set up by the appointed will of God; and that which is usurped by the depraved will of man. Also, what is the true government, which ought to be established in this and all Christian common-wealths. Published by authority.</title>
