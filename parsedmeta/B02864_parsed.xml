         <title>The dying lovers reprieve. Or, The reward of true love. With sighs and tears her love he doth desire, since Cupid hath his senses set on fire; his torment and his pain to her he shews, with all his protestations and his vows: at last she yields to grant him some relief, and make him joyful after all his grief. Tune of, Digby's farewel; or, Give me the lass, &amp;c. With allowance. Ro. L'Estrange.</title>
