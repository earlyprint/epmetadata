III. To the offence given by a book called an Anti-apologie, which I have said, is a great offence to the church of God; and that they, who write as Mr. Edwards does, too many by two, have offended their lord and master, more than Moses did, when he said, ye rebels, for which unadvised speaking (yet the people were little better) though he would, he could not compound with his lord God almighty. ... / By Hezekiah Woodward.</title>
