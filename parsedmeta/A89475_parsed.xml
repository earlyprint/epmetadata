         <title>A manifestation directed to the honourable Houses of Parliament in England, sent from the Lord Inchequin, the Lord Broghill, Sir Wil. Fenton, Sir Percy Smith, Lieut. Col. Will. Brocket, Lieut. Col. Thomas Serle, Sarjeant Major Muschamp; containing the reasons of their now opposing the cestation with the blood-thirsty Irish rebels; and their resolution to live and die in defence of the Parliament and Protestant cause in that Kingdom. As also, the joynt and unamimous declaration of His Majesties Protestant subjects in the Province of Munster, shewing to the whole world the many inhumane, cruell, and unheard of perfidious dealings, treacherous conspiracies, and horrid combinations of friers, priests and Jesuits, to betray the castles, forts and garrisons, and their murthering many Protestants in that province, contrary to the article of free commerce, and other articles of the late treaty.</title>
