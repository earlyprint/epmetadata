         <title>Mr. Read's case published for prevention of scandal to his brethren &amp; people, for encouragement to suffering Protestant dissenters, for a rebuke to their lawless adversaryes : being a leading-case how to deal with such men, and a practical answer to Dr. Stillingfleet, and others, who object against the non-conformists why will you not do what you confess to be lawful : humbly presented to our governours, in hopes of their forbearance towards us, in such things as we account sinful.</title>
