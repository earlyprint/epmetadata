      <title>The rebels almanack: calculated for the use of all loyal subjects within these his Majesties realms and dominions. Wherein is discovered, a new nest of old monsters; with all their secret wicked, and treasonable conspiracies, horrid plots, and bloody combinations, both against King and kingdoms. Likewise, the charge, judgmemt, and impeachment, against politick Lambert, seal-keeper Lisle, Blooms-bury Martin, blind-beetle Mayne, bloody Holland, and the London-apprentices circumsizing Pennington; who for all their abominable treasons and murthers, are to receive their just reward, and wages of death, at Tower-Hill and the gallows.</title>
