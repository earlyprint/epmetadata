         <title>Digitus dei. A faithful relation and collection of seven wonderful and remarkable judgements, lately inflicted by God on several persons using execrations and wicked wishes to themselves which suddenly came dreadfully to pass: viz. 1. A woman at Atherbury in Oxford-shire burnt to ashes all on one side, when there was no fire neer her, in May 1677. ... 7. A man in Suffolk that used to wish he might rot if he wronged people, before his death perisht away in a strange manner, perfect chalk-stones dropping out of the calves of his leggs. With an account of the circumstances of each judgement; and a most notable speech of a person of quality on the ladder about to be hang'd. With allowance. Ro L'Estrange.</title>
