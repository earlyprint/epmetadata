         <title>A brave memorable and dangerous sea-fight, foughten neere the road of Tittawan in Barbary where the George and Elizabeth (a ship of London) under the command of Mr. Edmond Ellison, having but 19. peeces of ordnance, was encompass'd and encountred by nine great Turkish pyrat ships, or men of war, they being in number of men at the least 60. to one; and their ordnance more than ten to one against the English, yet (by Gods assistance) they were encouraged to a resolute fight, and obtained a glorious victory over their miscreant enemies, and a happy returne with men, ship, and goods to London.</title>
