         <note>Sometimes attributed to Cheynell (Wing); "the writer cannot have been Cheynell, but some inferior person who wished to sell a catchpenny tract"--Madan.</note>
         <note>"This piece gives the heads of Erbery's position, but none of Cheynell's arguments, and is simply a short appeal to Parliament to stop Erbery's mouth and to support their own minister"--Madan.</note>
