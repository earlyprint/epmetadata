         <title>A declaration to Great Britain and Ireland, shewing the downfall of their princes, and wherefore it is come upon them: because Christ is riding on his white horse, conquering his enemies till he have destroyed Antichrist, who hath made the nations drunk with the cup of her fornications: and till he have destroyed Mahomet, that great deceiver of the people. / Written and directed to Great Britain, and all other nations; by me Robert Wharton, wel-wisher to my countrymen, and to all the faithfull in Christ Jesus throughout the world. With an humble advice to the Army. This treatise is approved and commended, and thought worthy to be printed, by Master Hugh Peters.</title>
