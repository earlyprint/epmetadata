         <title>A Catholick catechism shewing the impossibility the Catholick religion should be varied to the degree of a thought, from the measures left sealed by the apostles, without the loss of truth, and therefore the impossibility popery, or whatever else is not found in Scripture, should be Catholick : composed to the capacity of the meanest that will but consider, that they may know and be ready upon unmovable reasons, to give an apologie or defensive answer for the Catholick religion, if they are indeed of it, and be secured from temptation in times of danger.</title>
