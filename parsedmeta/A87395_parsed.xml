         <title>Joyful news for all Christendom. Being a happy prophesie of the Turks advancing to the Christian borders, where they shall consult against all Europe, and divide their whole power into three potent armies; one shall march into Poland and Silecia, the other towards the Rhine into France, and the third through the middle of Austria. With the gallant deportment of the Christians against their mighty armies, and the manner how they shall be utterly destroyed in 1662. Being a true copy taken out of the original March 16. 1661.</title>
