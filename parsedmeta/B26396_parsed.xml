         <title>The loyal garland of mirth and pastime Set forth in sundry pleasant [n]ew songs; the loyal health. An excellent new song of advice to bat[chel]ors, to refrain the society of wanton ladys. A new song of the Welshmans misfortune [sel]ling his land, and travelling up to London, [to se]ek the philosophers stone. A song of the bride and bridegroom. A pleasant new play-house song. [Al]l very pleasant and delightful to read. By S. M. [Th]ere is likewise added a coppy of the excellent Bell-mans verses.</title>
