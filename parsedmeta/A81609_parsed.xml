         <title>Dominium maris: or, The dominion of the sea. Expressing the title, which the Venetians pretend unto the sole dominion, and absolute sovereigntie of the Adriatick Sea, commonly called the gulph of Venice. Manifested in a pleading, or argument, betwixt the Republick of Venice and the Emperor Ferdinand. Whereby is sufficiently proved, that the sea as well as the land, is liable to the laws of proprietie, and may bee brought under the jurisdiction and protection of particular princes and states. Contrarie to the assertion of those, who affirm, the sea to bee free, and under the dominion of no man. Translated out of Italian.</title>
