         <title>An old bridle for a vvilde asse-colt. Or, the new mystery of iniquity unfolded, briefely discovering the physiognomy of a wanton youthfull king, carnall reason, who under the name of true reason bewitcheth, and deceiveth many unstable soules; for those whose sakes is here declared their cunning wiles, and flights; by which they do deceive, and draw disciples after them, to their own perpetuall disgrace, if not destruction. In a briefe commentary on the second of Peter, chap. 2. Where the apostle hath plainly prophesied  of that sort of antichristians, or false prophets, now commonly known by the name of ranters, whose unreasonable practises being only named, and laid open to view, wil be sufficient ground to reasonable men, to desert their wicked wayes, and societies, which they continue so infectious and disorderd. / By Raunce Burthall.</title>
