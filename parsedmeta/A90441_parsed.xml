         <title>Another bloudy fight at sea between the English and the Dutch; and the manner how the Lord Admiral Vantrump with threescore men of war, engaged Sir Geo: Ayscue and the Parliaments fleet upon the Downs, on Saturday last. With the particulars thereof, disputed with great gallantry on both sides; the playing of granadoes; the blowing up of the decks; the number of ships sunk, fir'd, and taken; the tacking about of the Parl. navy, to the protection of Dover Castle; and Vantrump still riding upon the downs. Also, the desperate resolution of his navy; and declaration concerning the cutting down of the banks, dams, and sea-walls, and drowning of the countrey: together with the concluding of a peace between the K. of France, and the K. of Spain, by the K. of Scots; and the setting up of the royal standard.</title>
