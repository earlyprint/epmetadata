Wherein sundry scriptures out of the prophets and apostles are cleared: the maintenance of ministers by tithes is by scripture fullly [sic] vindicated: several cases of conscience are resolved: several points of Christian religion are confirmed; parochial churches, and the practises of some things in these our English churches are throughly justified: the Grand Antichrist with the heretical antichrists are decyphered and parallelled.  By John Bewick minister of the Gospel, and rector of the parish church of Stanhop in Weredale in the county of Durham.</title>
