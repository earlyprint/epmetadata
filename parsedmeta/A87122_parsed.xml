         <title>Vox populi, or, Glostersheres desire: with, the way and means to make a kingdome happy (by Gods help.) By setting up of schoole-masters in every parish throughout the land generally. Being fit for the help of religious ministers in their heavenly worke. And for the removing of the three capitall enormities of this land, viz. ignorance, prophanesse and idlenesse. Set forth for the benefit of all the young children in the kings dominions: with schoole-lawes and orders, for every English schoole-master, and family, to have in their houses. For the training up young children, both in godlinesse and manners, for the good of the land. With the confuting of certain objections that would hinder and make void so good a worke. by Samuel Harmar.</title>
