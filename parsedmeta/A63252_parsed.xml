         <title>The Triumph of truth in an exact and impartial relation of the life and conversation of Col. Iames Turner, which he imparted to an intimate friend a little before his execution : to which is added his deportment and discourses in prison, the manner of his execution and burial : with other occurrences never yet made publique, and now published as a seasonable warning for others to avoid such strange miscarriages.</title>
