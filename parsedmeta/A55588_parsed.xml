Who was supposed to have been murthered by his own servant, and his servants mother and brother: but to the amazement of all the people that live near the said place, the truth is now brought to light; and Mr. Harrison after about two years absence is returned into his own country and place of abode in Cambden. The manner how he was bewitched away, and the manner of his safe return back again into his own countrey you shall hear in this following discourse.</title>
