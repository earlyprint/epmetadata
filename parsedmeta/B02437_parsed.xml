         <title>The couragious plow-man, or, The citizens misfortune. Being an incouragement to all plow-men, to exercise themselves in their youth with a cudgel, that they may the better know how to handle a sharper weapon, if need require. I shall not stand the subject to repeat, because the verses do it so compleat, to hear how meekly the citizens came off, I think it cannot chuse but make you laugh; the parties here I must forbear to name, for fear the author chance to bear the blame. To the tune of, Dick and Nan, or, The tyrant.</title>
