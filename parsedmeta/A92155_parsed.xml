Part 2, "Mercurius rusticus: or, The countries complaint, of the sacriledges, prophanations, and plundrings, committed by the schismatiques, on the cathedrall churches of this kingdome" has separate title page with imprint "Oxford, printed in the yeare, 1646"; pagination and register are continuouswith part 1. Parts 3 and 4, "Querela Cantabrigiensis" and "Micro-chronicon" each have separate dated title page, pagination, and register. The former is attributed to John Barwick, and the latter to Bruno Ryves. "Querela Cantabrigiensis" was also probably issued separately (Wing B1010), as was "Micro-chronicon" (Wing R2451).</note>
