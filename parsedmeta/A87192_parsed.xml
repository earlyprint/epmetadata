         <title>Londons charity inlarged, stilling the orphans cry. By the liberality of the Parliament, in granting two houses by Act, and giving a thousand pound towards the work for the imployment of the poor, and education of poor children, who many of them are destroyed in their youth for want of being under a good government and education, whereby they may be made serviceable for God, and the Commonwealth. Also this good work is much encouraged by the liberall contributions of many well-affected citizens of London, for the better carrying it on for the glory of God, the honor of the nation, and comfort of the helples poor. With a platform, how many officers needfull to govern 100 children in a work-house, with laws and orders for the schoolmaster to read to the children once a day for a time, afterwards twice a month, whereby they may be kept under a godly and civill government, to the great joy of good peopl. With other observations worthy the reading. / By S.H. a well-wisher to the nations prosperity, and the poors comfort.</title>
