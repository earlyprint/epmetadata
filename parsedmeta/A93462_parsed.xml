         <title>The souldiers pocket Bible: containing the most (if not all) those places contained in holy Scripture, which doe shew the qualifications of his inner man, that is a fit souldier to fight the Lords battels, both before he fight, in the fight, and after the fight; which Scriptures are reduced to severall heads, and fitly applyed to the souldiers severall occasions, and so may supply the want of the whole Bible, which a souldier cannot conveniently carry about him: and may bee also usefull for any Christian to meditate upon, now in this miserable time of warre.</title>
