         <title>Chiliasto-mastix redivivus, sive Homesus enervatus. A confutation of the millenarian [sic] opinion, plainly demonstrating that Christ will not reign visibly and personally on earth with the saints for a thousand yeers either before the day of judgement, in the day of judgement, or after it: where you also have many texts of scripture vindicated from the vain glosses of one Dr. Homes, a great Millenarian [sic], and all of his cavils (of any consequence) refelled and answered. With a word to our Fifth Monarch-Men, whose dangerous practises of late, clearly shew that this opinion leads to schisme, and sedition in church and state. / By Tho Hall B.D. and pastor of Kingsnorton.</title>
