      <note>Both Wing and Madan distinguish between two "editions" of 1667 [1677]: Wing A1137 (Madan 3133*), which is 12", lacks a frontispiece, and has an upper case "F" in "fifth impression" on the t.p., and Wing A1138 (Madan 3133), which is 8", has a lower case "f" and includes the frontispiece.  Although the film identifies 856:1 as A1137, it is in fact identical to 705:5 with frontispiece, octavo binding, and an "f" on the t.p.</note>
