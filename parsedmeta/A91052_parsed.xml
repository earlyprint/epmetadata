      <title>A short answer to a book set forth by seven priests, who call themselves ministers of the gospel of Christ; but are plainly discovered to be lyers, and slanderers, and envious of them who are the true ministers of Christ, who abide in his doctrine. With a vvord to the reader, to read with understanding, and let the light of Jesus Christ within judge; for to that in the conscience it is spoken.</title>
