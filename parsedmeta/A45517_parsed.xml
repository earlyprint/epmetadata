         <title>The key of sacred scripture, and, leading to it first, an answer to some objections given to the author, by a person of great learning and piety : wherein many mistakes, by which most professors wound themselves, and strengthen the hands of the churche's adversaries, are clearly discovered, and the more invincible weapons of truth inviolable (tending effectually to refel errors, and reform manners) are tendred to them / by Tho. Harby.</title>
