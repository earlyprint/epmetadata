      <title>A new balade entituled as foloweth. To such as write in metres, I write of small matters an exhortation, by readyng of which, men may delite in such as be worthy commendation. My verse also it hath relation to such as print, that they doe it well, the better they shall their metres sell. And when we haue doen al that ever we can, let vs neuer seke prayse at the mouth of man.</title>
