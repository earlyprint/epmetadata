         <title>Theios divine beames of glorious light. Shining from the sacred scriptures, which expell the fogges of error, that engender darknesse, in doubting soules, by mistaken thoughts, touching the diety, faith, and Christain ordinances. With a cordial to heal the corasives which the ill potion prepared by Mr. John Fry, a late member of Parliament, hath ingendred. / Written by one, who desires more that God may be glorified, then to affix his name to gain the vaine applause of man. Licensed and entered in the Stationeers Hall book.</title>
