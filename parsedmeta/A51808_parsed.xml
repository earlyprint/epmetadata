         <title>To the honourable the knights, citizens, and burgesses of the House of Commons in Parliament assembled, proposals most humbly offered for raising (in all likelyhood) upwards of five millions of money, without charging the poor, or burthening the rich by such ways and means, that (for the greatest part thereof) the payers will voluntarily tax themselves : as also some objections answered, and a method proposed for the easie collection thereof, with much certainty and small charge.</title>
