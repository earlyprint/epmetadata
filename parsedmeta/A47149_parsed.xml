         <title>Gross error and hypocrisie detected in George Whitehead and some of his brethern as doth appear from the disingenuous and hypocritical answer he and some others have given to some queries sent to the last Yearly Meeting of the people call'd Quakers, in the third month, 1695, by comparing the said answer with the printed books of the said George Whitehead, William Pemn, and John Whitehead, leading men in the said Meeting, wherein the great inconistency and contradiction of their present late answer to the express words and sentiments of their printed books is discovered : with a further account of their vile and pernicious errours / by George Keith.</title>
