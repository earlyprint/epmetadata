         <title>The aphorismes of the kingdome. 1. The Parliament is the moderation of monarchy. ... 2. The power of it is sufficient to prevent and restraine tyranny. ... 3. The essence of the law is the free consent of the law-makers. ... 4. The sole reason of the King is not the sound judgement of the kingdome. ... 5. All the votes in Parliament are directive to the law, none destructive. ... 6. The vote that is directive and coactive, is no wayes nomotheticall. ... 7. The negative vote of a King is no more than the dissent of one man. ... 8. The affirmative vote of a King makes not the law; ergo, the negative cannot destroy it. ... 9. He that cannot destroy a law made, cannot destroy it in the making. ... 10. The power that makes lawes, repeales and revives them as reason requires. ... 11. Kings that doe good to their subjects of bountie, would be free of the obligation. ... 12. Laws are the best directions and obligations for all men to follow. To submit the principality to the laws is more than the crowne. ...</title>
