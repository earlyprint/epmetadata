         <title>The late covenant asserted. 1. That it is in whole and in part agreeable to sacred scripture, holy, just, and good. 2. That Oxford-covenant is abominable, contrary to law, right reason, good sense; whereby it appeares, what keepers the lords of the world are of the scales and soules there. 3. That the protestation two years agon, and covenant now, are both one for substance; and a sweet agreement betweene all foure, protestation, covenant, oath of supremacy and allegeance. ... 9. A petition of the wild of Kent, and like places, shewing the sense of the inhabitants there: the root of all these mischiefes, the divine bishops, and their service-booke, which commands another treatise. 10. Oxfords covenant is annexed to the end, and the reason given in the next leafe. Licensed and entred to order.</title>
