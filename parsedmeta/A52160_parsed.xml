For the true information and reformation of the people. Or, sober sadness, and plain-dealing, in a few plain, sober, and sad country rhimes, concerning these sad and heavy times, conducing to a real, personal and national reformation in three sinful lands. To which is added the authours twelve years extream melancholy, with the vvoful effects thereof in him, and the best remedy which he used for the removal of them all. Also a joyful and thankful commemoration of His Majesties happy return to his three kingdoms.
