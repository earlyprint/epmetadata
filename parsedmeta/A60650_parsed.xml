      <title>A second relation from Hertford containing the unjust proceedings of some called justice there at the general quarter sessions, upon the tryal of one and twenty innocent persons called Quakers for a pretended breach of the late act, with an account of the most material passages between the prisoners and the court, the 3d, 4th, and 5th dayes of the 8th moneth, 1664 : whereby it appears that meeting to worship God in spirit and truth is the great crime for which they are under so grievous a sentence, and that whatever is pretended by those that love the title of justice, yet in very deed they hate justice it self, as by their proceedings appears / by W.S.</title>
