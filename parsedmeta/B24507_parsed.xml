      <title>Symbol&#275;, sive Conflictus cum antichristo: or, Reflections upon, and an answer to Mr. No-bodies dialogue feigned between an old Q Elizabeth Protestant, and his neighbour, as far as the writings and person of John Humphries, are therein abused and calumniated through the malice of a second Bo-peep author. Wherein falsely and maliciously he is made a papist by Mr. Momus that lies hid in the belly of the Trojan horse; with a parallel of the principles of a papist and a true Protestant, and a brief confession of the faith of the author.</title>
