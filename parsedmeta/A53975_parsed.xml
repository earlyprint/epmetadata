         <title>God's call to unconverted sinners to turn to the Lord Plainly shewing every poore sinner the miserableness of his estate, and how great an enermy he is to himself; that though the Lord be daily calling him, to turn and live, and professeth he deights not in the death of a sinner; yet for all this he will go and die. Allso [sic] the happy condition of the people of God, in that they have such a Father that had rather see their conversion, then condemnation. And lastly, to the terror of wicked and ungodly men is set forth: that if they will not turn to God that they may live with him in Heaven, they shall dye, and b: [sic] tormented with the Devil and his angels in hell fire.
