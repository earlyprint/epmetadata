      <note>Seafaring men have not gained by the late war. Customs are paid so that the seas may be guarded, but now there is no convoy to the Netherlands or France, so that all goods are sent in Dutch bottoms who can set sail in a day. Cites statutes forbidding this. Prays that four or five ships be set apart as constant convoys between Gravesend and the Netherlands. [With two orders of the Commons concerning the matter] -- Cf. Steele.</note>
      <note>At foot: This petition being presented by several masters and commanders of ships, the honorable House of Commons after the reading thereof made two orders to this effect: Die Lun&#230;, 11 September 1648. Ordered by the Commons assembled in Parliament, that it be referred to the Committee of Complaints to receive the particular grievances complained of in by the petitioners, and that they report them to this House. Ordered that a reference be sent unto the lord admirall, to the end that a constant convoy may be provided to guard the merchant ships, for the advance of the trade of the nation.</note>
