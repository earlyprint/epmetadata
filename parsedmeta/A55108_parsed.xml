      <title>A plea for the late accurate and excellent Mr. Baxter and those that speak of the sufferings of Christ as he does. In answer to Mr. Lobb's insinuated charge of Socinianism against 'em, in his late appeal to the Bishop of Worcester, and Dr. Edwards. With a preface directed to persons of all persuasions, to call 'em from frivolous and over-eager contentions about words, on all sides.</title>

      <note>Stephen Lobb's "Appeal to the Right Reverend Edward Lord Bishop of Worcester" was published in 1698; "Mr. Baxter" in the title is Richard Baxter, the presbyterian divine, who died in 1691.</note>
      <note>This is the parting shot in an ongoing controversy between presbyterians and independents, largely fueled by Lobb and John Humfrey, in which the presbyterian non-conformists are accused of Socinianism.</note>
