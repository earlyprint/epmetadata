      <title>A short relation of what is believed amongst the people of God touching the divers points of religion. 1. Concerning the Word of God, the fall of man, and restauration by Christ. 2. Concerning the Scriptures. 3. Concerning faith, love and works. 4. Concerning baptism and the Lords Supper. 5. Concerning the Sabbath. 6. Concerning tythes. 7. Concerning swearing. Although many of the servants of God have born a large testimony in these latter dayes, in which the Lord is establishing the mountain of his own house a top of all mountains, Isaiah 2. 2. ... therefore in love to the truth, and in the motion of the gift received, I give my testimony of these things in the year 1666.
