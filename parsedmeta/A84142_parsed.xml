         <title>An elegie and epitaph on that glorious saint, and blessed martyr, King Charles I. The best of kings since Christ, but murther'd by the worst of men since the creation. Written a day or two after his martyrdom ... Now published to shew the world the unparallel'd patience and piety of the dead murther'd King; and the matchlesse impudence and impiety of his past and present living murtherers. For the suspition of which, and many other things, the author lay almost two years in the gate-house, defying all the insolent and illagal usurpation, and power at Westminster and White-Hall. Saying alwayes ... God bless King Charles the Second.</title>
