         <title>Bloody actions performed. Or, A brief and true relation of three notorious murthers committed by three bloud-thirsty men, 2. upon their own wives. The one was done in the county of Kent, in the Isle of Tenet, Decemb. last. The other was done at Islington, neere unto London, this present year, 1653. The third was done upon a major in Coven-Garden neere London. Arthur Knight and Thomas Laret was executed, March 2. 1653. This coppy was drawn up on purpose to give the world satisfaction, whereby to know in what manner the murders was committed: being the very truth, and no more but the truth.</title>
