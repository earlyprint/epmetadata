Edwards, Scavenger Generall, throughout Great-Britaine, New England, and the united Provinces, chiefly Amsterdam, and Munster, and indeed by vertue of some faire pretences, intermeddler in all the states of Christendome, principally there where any thing of the spirit of Christ in the Saints appeares, trenching upon the honour, dignity, and preferment of the old man. The grand reformer, (alias reducer) of the free born sons of God, into the chaines of the their old Babilonish captivity, under the pretence of a Jus Divinum. At his dwelling in Club Courtbetween the Pope and Prelate, a little on this side the fagot in Smithfield, (or if in his monthely Pilgrimage) in the suburbs of Canterbury, at the knowne house of Mistris Gangrena Triplex, where conscience and he (but for a time we hope) shook hands and had each other farewell. Where he was lately discovered by many eye-witnesses: and where you may be sure at any time to meet with him. Published by authority.</title>
