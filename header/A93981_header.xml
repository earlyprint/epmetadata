      <title>Strange and wonderful news being a true, tho' sad relation of six sea-men. (Belonging to the Margaret of Boston,) who sold themselves to the devil, and were invisibly carry'd away. : With an account of the said ship being sunk under water, where she continued full eleven weeks : all which time, to admiration, the rest of the ship's crew liv'd, and fed upon raw meat, and live fish, that swam over their heads. : The names of three persons, that were (thro' mercy) preserv'd so long under water, were William Davies, (a man very well known to the merchants in London,) Mr. VVilliam Kadner, and Mr. William Bywater. : There was only one boy drowned. : The truth of which strange and miraculous relation, will be attested at Mr. Loyd's coffee house, near the general post-office, in Lombard-Street; where the original letter at large, will be shewn to any person that desires to be further satisfy'd in the truth hereof; : and by several eminent merchants upon the Exchange.</title>
