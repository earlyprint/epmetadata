      <title>Londons glory, and Whittingtons renown or, A looking-glass for citizens of London Being a remarkable story, how Sir Richard Whittington (a poor boy bred up in Lancashire) came to be three times Lord Mayor of London in three several kings reigns, and how his rise was by a cat, which he sent for a venture beyond sea. Together with his bountiful gits and liberality given to this honourable city: and the vast sums of money he lent the King to maintain the vvars in France. And how at a great feast to which he invited the King, the Queen, and the nobility, he generously burnt the writings, and freely forgave his Majesty the whole debt. Tune of, Dainty come thou to me.</title>
