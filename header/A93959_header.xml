      <title>Strange and bloody nevves from Miniard: or A bloodie massacre upon five Protestants by a company of papists, meeting them as they were going to Miniard to take ship for Ireland. Also how they first encountred them, and how after some discourse upon religion, cruelly murdered them. As also, how they were taken, and carryed to Bristow Castle. With the copy of a letter found in one of their dublets, directed to the Bishop of Canterburie. As it was credibly reported by a gentleman of good worth, being an eyewitness to the same, and by the swiftness of his horse, escaped their bloodie hands,</title>
