      <title>A true prophecie of the mighty day of the Lord Which is coming, and is appeared in the north of England, and is rising toward the south; and shall overspread this nation and all the nations of the world. Wherein the Lord is redeeming Sion forth of her long inthral'd captivity in Babylons kingdom, where she hath been scattered in the cloudy and dark day, into forms and observations, and there kept by the priests, and teachers of the world, who ranne when God never sent them. Now is the Lord appearing in this day of his might power, to gather his elect together, out of all forms observations, kinreds, tongues, and nations; ... A word from the Lord to all the inhabitants of England, rulers, priests and people, to haste to meet the Lord with speedy repentance, and turning within, to harken diligently to his counsel, ... From the spirit of the Lord, written by one whose name in the flesh is William Dewsbury, called Quaker with the people of the world, who live in their perishing nature.</title>
