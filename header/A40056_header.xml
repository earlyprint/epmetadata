      <title>Four queries resolved for the satisfaction of all men, who are not willingly ignorant, touching the late arch-bishop I. What his religion was, he so coloured over at his death?, II. What his church was, he so bemoaned at that time?, III. What his confessions was?, IV. And prayer, which his brethren, in iniquity, do approve of at this day : concluded that all those four are so many abominations before the Lord God, and all good men.</title>
