      <title>A discovery of the first wisdom from beneath, and the second wisdom from above. Or, The difference betwixt the two seeds, the one after the flesh, the other after the spirit. With the true worship of God after the spirit, and the false worship of the world, who lives in outward forms, useth customes and traditions, not knowing the onely true God that dwelleth in his saints, and rules by his spirit of power, which causeth them to differ from the world, and those that have the form of godlinesse, and want the power thereof. ... Written by a servant of the Lord, whom the world scornfully nicknameth, and calleth a Quaker, who is prisoner for the testimony of the truth at Applebie in Westmorland, whose name is James Nayler.</title>
