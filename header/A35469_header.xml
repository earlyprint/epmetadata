          <note>B4r is misnumbered 13. It contains a list of 21 paintings with caption title "An appendix to the paintings". B3r is also numbered 13, and also contains an appendix, but lists only 7 paintings. B4 is probably intended to cancel B3, but both are present in the only known copy, and are included in the pagination above.</note>
