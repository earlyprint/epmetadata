      <title>To all the inhabitants of the earth this is sent as a warning from the Lord, vvho hath been long grieved with a sinful and an adulterous generation; but against the fulness of transgression hath prepared vialls full of wrath to cast upon the head of wicked and ungodly men. Here is also the vain traditional worship of both priest and people (in short) plainly made menifest to all those that art not willing to remain in ignorance, which for many years hath overspread the whole world; but now is the son of righteousness arising, which discovereth all deceivers and deceivableness, and causeth the lowly, meek and innocent to understand wisdom. Written by a servant of the Lord, who is known to you by the name of John Higgins.</title>
