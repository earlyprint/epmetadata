      <title>Good nevves from all quarters of the kingdome; particularly from Gloucester. The more strange for the noveltie; first printed, and at that time when the adversary was storming that citie; and yet more strange, for its antiquitie, because assured us by a word, more stable than the earth or heaven; and by a letter of ancient date, sent to Hezekiah King of Judah. Wee have the same assurance also touching a strange destruction to the wicked, specially to those princes all, who have filled the land with bloud, that those shall not dye the common death, nor be visited after the visitation of all men, because they have done more wickedly then ever any princes before them. ... Published for the comfort of all the Godly, in all the quarters of the world, by speciall licence from their Court-booke, September 12. 1643.</title>
