      <title>Five strange and wonderful prodigies: or, A full and true relation of supernatural sights and aparitions lately seen in the air viz. Tvvo great armies drawn up in battalia, and seeming ready to engage each other, beheld for some hours, by several thousands of people: with dreadful noises heard, like the discharge of cannons and musquets, accompanied with hideous crys and howling. As also a fiery-bullet of a most vast magnitude violently rushing through the air, and at last with a most terrible crack breaking into a thousand pieces, to the unspeakable terror of the amazed spectators. As it is certified by several persons of quality. With an astrological judgement thereupon.</title>
