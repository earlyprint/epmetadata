      <title>An answer to a late pamphlet, called A Sober dialogue, between a Scotch Presbyterian a London church-man, and a real Quaker, scandalously reflecting on the Church of England as if her doctrine and common-prayer did justifie the antichristian doctrine, of the real Quaker, viz. that the light within, whither in heathen, or Christian is sufficient to salvation without anything else; wherein the plain deism and antichristian principles of the real Quaker and his party, and the pretended church man, are plainly detected. By a friend to the author of the dialogue, called, a Sober dialogue, between a country friend, a London friend, and one of G.K.'s friends.</title>
