      <title>A view of fundamental principles first in general and then in particular. Divided into three parts. The first part, containing a general view of the common nature of fundamentals of religion, handling many difficult questions about them, and pointing (in the conclusion) to a sufficient and particular catalogue of twelve great principles, the subject of both the other parts. The second part, beginning a particular view of fundamentals, with a discourse of the six first principles, out of six several texts of Scripture. The third part, continuing, and concluding, the said particular view, with a discourse of the six last principles, out of one eminent text, viz. Heb. 6. 1, 2. By Robert Walwyn minister of the word and sacraments.</title>
