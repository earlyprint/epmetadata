          <note>The imprint is fictitious; in fact printed in London by E. Griffin (STC).</note>
          <note>The "ph" in "Oenozphthopolis" is a Greek letter phi. The place name is probably a mistranscription of "Oenozytholpoli" in a Latin edition.</note>
          <note>The roman numeral date is made with turned C's.</note>
          <note>"The smoaking age, or, the man in the mist" has separate dated title page with imprint "Oenozphthopolis. At the signe of Teare-nose. MDCXVII."; pagination and register are continuous.</note>
          <note>"A solemn joviall disputation" is sometimes attributed to Richard Brathwait, but is in fact his translation, with additions, of the pseudonymous "Disputatio inauguralis theoretico-practica jus potandi breviter adumbrans" by Blasius Multibibus (pseudonym). "The smoaking age" is apparently Brathwait's alone.</note>
          <note>The plates, signed by William Marshall, bear the titles "The lawes of drinking." and "The smoaking age or the life and death of tobacco.".</note>
          <note>"At least 1 NY-Arents copy has a leaf of letterpress explanation preceding each frontispiece, lacking in most (all other?) copies."--STC. These are not included in pagination above.</note>
          <note>Reproduction of the original in Cambridge University Library (second part only).</note>
