      <title>The English banner of truth displayed: or, The state of this present engagement against Scotland. Wherein is soberly discuss'd the lawfulness and necessity of the engagement. The high aggravations of it, as to the Scots. The groundlesness of those of the Presbyteries coniunction with the Scots and malignants, either from religion, their former state-principles, or the demeanour of those those [sic] in authority towards them. Also, a brief series of transactions, whereby it appears that those of the Presbytery have continually endeavoured the disturbing of the peace of the nation, ... and are the ground of this third war now with the Scots and malignants. Together with some occasional assertions; that the laying aside of some members of Parliament, the proceedings against the late King, the changings of the government, is sutable unto the end of all our engagements ... / By a friend to the Commonwealth of England.</title>
