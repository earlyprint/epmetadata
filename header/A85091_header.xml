Richard Farnham and Iohn Bull; who affirmed themselves the two great prophets which should come in the end of the world, mentioned Revel. 11. Also that the plague should not come nigh their dwelling. Neverthelesse being prisoners, the one in Old-Bridewell, the other in New-Bridewell, by a strange providence of almighty God, both the one and the other dyed of of the plague in a house where they usually met, in Rosemary-Lane, in Ianuary last, 1641.
