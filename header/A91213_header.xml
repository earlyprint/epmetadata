      <title>The Lords &amp; Commons first love to, zeale for, and earnest vindication of their injuriously accused and impeached Members, and violated priviledges. Manifested by their owne printed declarations, petitions, votes, in the case of the Lord Kimbolton, Mr. Denzill Holles, and some other Members, impeached by the Kings atornie, Mr. Herbert, (by the Kings owne speciall command) of high treason, in Ianuary 1641. With a paralell of Cromwells plot, in bringing the Army to London, with Henry Jermins and Percyes. And a briefe recitall of two ancient judgements in former Parliaments; proving, that it is no lesse then treason, for any to impeach Lords and Members of treason, for any thing acted by them, in, or by authority of Parliament; and that the Lords and Commons in this Parliament have, in effect, voted and declared as much. Humbly submitted to the consideration of both Houses, and of all such who by their covenant, and protestation are obliged to defend the priviledges of Parliament; and bring the infringers of them and malicious false impeachers of their Members to condigne punishment.</title>
