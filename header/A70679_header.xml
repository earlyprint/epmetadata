      <title>The case and trial of Capt. Robert Norwood, now prisoner in New-gate, truely and impartially stated, and published for satisfaction of my allied friends, and very many others desirous thereof. Together with some observations upon the law and its professors, very worthy a most serious consideration. Both which, (with a brief answer, by way of postscript, to a secret calumny charged upon me) are here presented to the view and judgement of the whole nation: which, if duly considered, with the shrot [sic] discourse annexed, will clearly discover where England's death and life lies.</title>
