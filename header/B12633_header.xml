          <note>"Refers to Proc. 30 April, 1551 ... that from 31 August the 1s. should be current at 9d. and the groat at 3d. This order has been abused and misinterpreted. The coin shall be purified. Engrossers of Farms, victual, grain, &amp;c., and wool, who are chief causers of the dearth, are threatened with displeasure. Offenders will be punished by the King, and are not to be moved against by private persons." -- Steele.</note>
