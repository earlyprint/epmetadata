          <note>Pt. 1 of the Spanish original was first printed at Lisbon in 1609, with colophon dated 1608; pt. 2 was first printed at Cordova in 1616.</note>
          <note>" ... [Rycaut] had a very slight knowledge of the Spanish language and he did not scruple to make wild guesses at the meaning of sentences, and to omit whole chapters. Thus he only gives fourteen out of the twenty-six chapters in the first book, and sixteen out of the twenty-six in the second."--C.S. Markham's introd. to the First part of the Royal commentaries, 1869-71, v. 1, p. xvi.</note>
