      <title>The copy of a letter printed at New-Castle, July the 6, 1647. Sent from the adjutators of the army under His Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, unto their fellow-souldiers in the garrisons of New-Castle and Tinmouth. Advising them 1. That they will not suffer themselves to be broken in pieces by any discouragements, but performe the trust reposed in them in those places of strength and confidence wherein they are. 2. That they will not upon any pretended order whatsoever, betray their trust, or deliver up their garrison into the hands of any, untill they shall receive commands from the generall, whose warrant only is able to beare them out in it. 3. That they would endeavour to hold correspondence with them, by appointing some faithfull men, who may at all times acquaint them with their condition. With divers other matters of remarkable consequence.</title>
