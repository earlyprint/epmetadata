      <title>A vvarning from the Lord to the pope; and to all his train of idolatries: with a discovery of his false imitations, and likenesses, and traditional inventions, which is not the power of God. And a testimony against his foundation, to the overthrow of the whole building: and a witness by the spirit of God against his dead-worship of dead idols; and the false imitation of false crosses, which is not the power of God unto salvation, but delusion unto damnation. And the day of visitation held forth, that they may make their peace with the Lord; and the way of peace declared, which is Christ Iesus the light of the world, who lightneth every man that comes into the world; and the mysterie of the true cross of Christ, which is the power of God unto salvation revealed: and also some quæries given forth to be answered by the pope, his priests or Jesuits, or them who are popishly affected. / By a lover of souls, G.F.</title>
