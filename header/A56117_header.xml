According to Heb. 10. 24. Printed for help of such as would do the same to their rich friends and acquaintance, but have no better way for it then conveying such a book into their hands or closets. Some digressions incerted. Those relating to the doctrine of the Trinity, being occasioned by an essay to reduce a very useful person from Arianisme. Also an exemplification of some particulars of good works.</title>
