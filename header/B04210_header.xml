      <title>The love-sick maid quickly revived. Within the prime time of the Spring, vvithin a meadow she did sing; and solemnly these words she said, I fear that I shall dye a maid: but her sweetheart in ambush lay, and heard the words that she did say; as in this ditty you may hear if that you please but to give ear. Tune is, What shall I do, shall I dye for love, &amp;c. Or, the Hay-makers.</title>
