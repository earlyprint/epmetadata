      <title>Horometria: or the compleat diallist: wherein the whole mystery of the art of dialling is plainly taught three several wayes; two of which are performed geometrically by rule and compasse onely: and the third instrumentally, by a quadrant fitted for that purpose. With the working of such propositions of the sphere, as are most usefull in astronomie and navigation, both geometrically and instrumentally. / By Thomas Stirrup, philomath. Whereunto is added an appendix, shewing now the parallels of declination; the Jewish, Babylonish, and Italian houres; the azimuths, almicanters, &amp;c. may be easily inscribed on any diall whatsoever, by rule and compasse onely.
