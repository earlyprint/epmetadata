With some soft reflections upon his Catholick (or rather Cathulactick) key; and an examen of the late petition of the sixth of July to this Parliament. In all which we have a most necessary vindication of the cause; of the honourable persons now in Parliament and Council, from the venome and vilification of their pens. By Joh. Rogers, thorugh grace kept (under many sufferings) a faithful servant to Jesus Christ, his cause and the Commonwealth.</title>
