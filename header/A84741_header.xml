      <title>Truths vindication of election, and reprobation Wherein is shewed, Christ the cause of election; sin the cause of reprobation. The iustice of God is likewise cleared from that which is layd upon him by many; (namely) that some shall one day be damned for unbelief, and yet he never gave a Christ for them to beleeve in. Most of the strongest objections that scriptures or reason can make, answered. By William Fouler minister of the gospel at Ingworth in Norffolk.</title>
