      <title>The apostolical and true opinion concerning the Holy Trinity, revived and asserted; partly by twelve arguments levyed against the traditional and false opinion about the Godhead of the Holy Spirit: partly by a confession of faith touching the three Persons. Both which, having been formerly set forth in those yeers which the respective titles bear, are now so altered, so augmented, what with explications of the Scripture, what with reasons, what finally with testimonies of the fathers, and of others, together with observations thereupon, that they may justly seem new.</title>
