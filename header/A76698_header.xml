      <title>The apostolical and true opinion concerning the Holy Trinity, revived and asserted partly by twelve arguments levied against the traditional and false opinion about the Godhead of the Holy Spirit. Partly by a confession of faith touching the Three Persons. Both which having been formerly set forth, were much altered and augmented, with explications of Scripture, and with reasons: and finally, with testimonies of the Fathers, and of others. All reprinted, anno 1653. By John Bidle, M.A. And now again with the life of the author prefixed, anno Dom. 1691.</title>
