      <title>A word of advice to all such as are going on in sin and more particularly to my neighbours and townsmen in and about Colchester; to forsake their evil ways, and turn to the Lord while they have time, with a word of incouragement to such as mourn for want of salvation. And a word of advice to the priests of this nation, that they choak not the tender desires that are begotten in people after holiness.</title>
