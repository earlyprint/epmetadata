          <note>The Court of Aldermen on Oct. 2nd by a majority declined to allow any abridgment of their privileges as contained in their Charter, which had been adjudged forfeited and liable to be seized into the King's hands.  Thereupon judgment was entered up and the Charter was actually seized and the King by commission appointed the Lord Mayor and other officers. cf. Crawford, J.L.L. Catalogue of English Broadsides, 1505-1897.</note>
