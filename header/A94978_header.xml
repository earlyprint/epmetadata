      <title>A True and sad relation of the burning, sinking, and blowing up of the English ships in the river of Thames, on Thursday and Fryday last. With the manner how one of them floted up to the bridge in a flaming fire, and there gave a most terrible and dreadful blow with gunpowder, renting the houses, splitting the boats, and tearing of divers limb from limb. With the names and number of the men women, and children, that suffered in this dismall, and woful accident: some having their brains dasht against the walls: others, their legs and arms shot off: and divers lamentably mortifi'd, to the great astonishment of many thousands. Likewise, the discovery of a desperate and dangerous conspiracie upon the river; and the apprehending of a gentleman on Fryday night last, with divers granadoes and fire-works.</title>
