      <title>Bloudy newes from the East-Indies: being a true relation, and perfect abstract of the cruel, barbarous, and inhumane proceedings of the Dutch-men against the English at Amboyna: ... the unjust tryall of the English marchants and factors: their examinations and confessions: the bloudy sentence pronounced against them: and the manner how Capt. Towerson, Mr. Tompson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Beomont, Mr. Clerk, and divers others, were hang'd up by the hands on a large door, where they were made fast upon two iron staples, and their hands and legs stretched asunder; as also burning them with lighted torches under their armpits, &amp; with lighted candles in the bottom of their feet, under the elbows, and in the palm of their hands. Then they bound a cloth about their necks and faces very close, and powring water upon their heads, till the cloth was full up to the nostrils, stifled them, forcing their eyes to start of their heads; their cheekes to seem like great bladders; and each mans body to swell as big as three. With their speeches at the place of execution; at which instant a great darkness arose. / These particulars are averred by Mr Ramsey, a merchant; an eye-witness of their martyrdoms; who desires the publishing thereof throughout all England. Signed, James Ramsey.</title>
