      <title>The whirl-wind of the Lord gone forth as a fiery flying roule, with an alarm sounded against the inhabitants of the north-countrey. Being a fore-warning to all the rulers in England, of the mighty and terrible day of the Lord, which shall overtake the wicked; but especially and in particular, to the persecuting rulers, priests, and people, in the county of Westmerland. Who by their fruits are made manifest to all, to be open enemies to Sions converts, and a generation of evil doers, with whom the Lord Jehovah is coming to plead the cause of the oppressed, and to redeem Zion with judgement, and her converts with righteousness. G.T.</title>
