      <title>A Declaration from the Children of Light (who are by the world scornfully called Quakers) against several false reports, scandals and lyes, in several news books and pamphlets, put forth by Hen. Walker, R. Wood, and George Horton, whose lyes, and slanders shall not pass for truth; but shall be judged, and cast out by Michael and his angels into the world, which is their habitation amongst the children of darkness. Also a warning from the Lord to all ballad-makers, and image-makers, with them that print and sell them, who are found without the fear of God, contrary to the command of God, who saith, you shall not make an image of male nor female: and to the doctrine of the Apostles, who were to avoid prophane and vain fables. With a lamentation over all them that live in pride and gluttony, swearing, and all manner of uncleanness; and profess God, and profess Christ, and themselves Christians; but are seen to be those, whose God is their belly, whose end will be destruction.</title>
