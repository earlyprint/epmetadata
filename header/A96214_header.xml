      <title>Questions propounded by the natural man by way of reasoning. And answered by the spiritual man: but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them: it is written for the use of them that halteth, that they may be gathered: in which reason Babylon is fanned, and her land emptied, for so it is written. Whereunto is added a few lines for the rulers of the land, in love to their souls.</title>
