      <title>A declaration against anabaptists: to stop the prosecution fo [sic] their errours, falsly pretended to be a vindication of the royall commission of King Jesus, as they call it. Briefly and fully answering all their allegations, and clearly proving the anabaptisticall doctrine to be against the glory of God, the honour of Christ and his church, against the covenant of grace, and against the word of God, and the priviledges of the church made over to them by promise, and also against the solemne league and covenant of the three kingdomes. In answer to a book, by Francis Cornwall, presented to the House of Commons, on Friday last, for which he is committed.</title>
