      <title>Fire from heaven, falling upon the present army and the churches: or, Two words from the Lord to both· Held forth to the understanding of those, that make not flesh their arm, and whose hope the Lord is, that cease from man (a piece of earth) whose breath is in his nostrils. As also to the terror and astonishment of all those, who lean upon the broken staff of Egypt, and trust in horses, and strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and joy in the shadow of men; and cry to themselves, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord. / By a man of their councel.</title>
