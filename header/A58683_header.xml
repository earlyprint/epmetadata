      <title>A discovery of the true standard-gallon of England what it is, when, and by whom made, and where it is to bee found. By which the assizes of wine, ale, and corn, are to be justly known according to the proportions they bear to this standard-gallon. The which assizes are mentioned in the treatise called Composito Mensurarum, and in all other old books of assizes. This standard being not known to the commissioners and farmers of the excise of beer, and ale, in London, &amp;c. As appeareth by their non-observances of the assizes of beer and ale, giveth a just occasion of the brewers fifth complaint.</title>
