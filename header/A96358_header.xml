      <title>The charitable farmer of Somersetshire: or, God's great and vvonderful vvork. Being a true relation of an honest, godly man, that lived at Welling, within three mile of the city of Wells, which sold his wheat to poor people at six shillings a bushel, when the market price was ten and eleven shillings, for which he was much derided and scoft at, by his rich neighbours: but was recompenced by an extraordinary crap [sic] of wheat, like never before heard of, each stolk of straw, having divers full large ears, some seven, some eight, nine, and ten, so to thirteen, but generally ten ears on every straw throughout the field, which was ten acres and upwards, of which, divers ears are to be seen at divers coffee-houses in the city of London. Likewise a pattern of all covetous greedy-minded men, to be charitable unto their poor neighbours, from the consideration of so remarkable an example. / By Law. White.</title>
