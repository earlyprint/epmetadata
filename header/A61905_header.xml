      <title>A warning unto apostates &amp; backsliders that formerly have made a profession of the truth, but walk not answerably thereunto but are crucifying to themselves afresh the Son of God, and putting him unto open shame, and thereby are treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the reighteous judgements of the Lord : also a visitation and warning to all workers of iniquity, that they may repent and turn to the Lord with speed, before his dreadful judgments be poured forth upon them / by Richard Stubbs.</title>
