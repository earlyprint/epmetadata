          <note>Wing attributes to John Danvers, who wrote "The royal oake, or, An historical description of the royal progress, wonderful travels, miraculous, escapes, and strange accidents of his sacred Majesty Charles the II (Wing D237). However, the style and tone of the work here being catalogued is very different from Danvers' work. Another candidate for part 1 is "The royal pilgrimage, or The progresse and travels of King Charles the Second, through the most and greatest courts of Europe" (Wing R2142), but again tone and style seem to be wrong.</note>
          <note>Also published later in the same year in Edinburgh with title: The royal pilgrimage of His sacred Majesty King Charles the Second (Wing R2142A).</note>
          <note>Reproduction of original in the Folger Shakespeare Library.</note>
