      <title>Vox turturis vel columba alba albionis=The voice of the turtle, or, Englands white dove in the deluge of division, the second time sent forth from Gods Arke, to prsent a peace-offering upon the altar of Jehovah Shalom. Humbly proposing that divine direction, which the God of Peace hath revealed in his word of truth, for determining differences by an holy ordinance of his owne institution, wherein himselfe is the sole judge, ... Shewing how by this divine way of Gods judgement, not onely the great differences here in church and state depending, may speedily and happily be determined with glory to God, honour to the King, and happinesse to the kingdomes, but also all the greatest controversies, both civill and sacred throughout Christendome may be composed, the effusion of blood prevented, many prophecies conducing to an universall peace fulfilled, the happy use of this holy ordinance made knowne, and the name of God thereby manifested, ... even among heathens. / Per E. M. Arm. Christi servorum minimo minorem.</title>
