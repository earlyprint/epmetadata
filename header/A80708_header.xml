      <title>A beneficial proposal, wherein all adventurers are gainers for exchanging the blank tickets, and 10l. benefit tickets in the Million-Adventure, by making them much more valuable than now they are, to all persons that shall bring them into this proposal, made by R. Carter, and others. As likewise shewing, the great difference betwixt those proposals made by Tho. Neale, and Dalby Thomas, Esquires, and this now proposed; which last will appear to be much more the advantage to the adventurers than that formerly proposed by T.N. and D.T.</title>
