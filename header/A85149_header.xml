      <title>The Scriptures vindication against the Scotish contradictors. By one John Stalham, and as he saith, preacher of the Gospel at Edenborough in Scotland. And the other tiled [sic], A serious review of some principles of the Quakers; wherein error is discovered, and truth defended; by P.E. and written with a pen at Edenborough, printed in the year 1655, and a written name, as if it were the printer called Peter English, but no printed name; and thus they shuffle, but laid open to their shame, and truth in this short answer is defended and cleared, and their errour is discovered, and they ensnared. Who both have manifested their contradictions both to the Scriptures, and their own writings, and so have not the people which they call Quakers. / Published by a servant of the Lord Jesus, in Yorkeshire in England, known to the world by the name of Richard Farneworth.</title>
