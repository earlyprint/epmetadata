      <title>Coridon and Parthenia, the languishing shepherd made happy. Or, Faithful love rewarded. Being a most pleasant and delectable new play song. Here mournful love is turn'd into delight, to this we a chast amorist invite; where charming beauty rules its powr's like death, to save or murder with the self-same breath: the noble swain, whose youthful love hath won so many mymphs [sic], by love was here undone: languishing faint, on the gold ground he lies, until the sun-shine of Parthenia's eyes dissolv'd the cloud that did benight his bliss, and turn'd his torments into Paradise. To the tune of, When busie fame.</title>
