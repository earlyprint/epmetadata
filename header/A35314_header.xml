      <title>The parable of the great supper opened Wherein is set forth the fulness of Gospel-provision. The frank and free invitation of Jews and Gentiles to this Supper: the poor excuses of the recusant guests that were invited. The faithful returns which the messengers make unto the Lord of their refusal. God's displeasure against those who slight his favours: his bringing in of despicable creatures to fill his house: with the condemnation of those that were bidden. Methodically and succinctly handled by that judicious divine, Mr. John Crump, late of Maidstone in Kent.</title>
