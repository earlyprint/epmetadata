          <note>Cawdrey first attacked Cotton in 1645, in a work entitled, "Vindiciae clavium." Cotton answered in "The way of the Congregationall churches cleared," 1648.  Cawdrey then published "The inconsistencie of the independent way," 1651.  Cotton's "Defence" is a reply to the charges against him in the last named work.</note>
          <note>The controversy between Cawdrey and Owen is as follows: Owen's work "Of schism" appeared in 1657, and was answered by Cawdrey in "Independencie, a great schism." Owen rejoined in "A review of the true nature of schism," whereupon Cawdrey published "Independency further proved to be a schism," 1658. This was the "late treatise" to which the preface "Of schisme" of the present work is a reply.</note>
