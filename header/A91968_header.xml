      <title>The late conflagration consumed my own, together with the stock of books (as it were) of the Company of Stationers, London: since that lamentable disaster next my own loss; this doth trouble me, that when any of those few ingenious persons who desire books inquire after them, they are often answered by such as have them not, that they are all burnt, which discourageth any further enquiry, not only to the learned, but even of country chapmen, wherefore to let all men know notwithstanding the late dreadful calamity, that there are books yet to be had, and for the conveniency of the ingenious buyers, I publish this ensuing catalogue. For the litteral faults of the printer to book-buyers, I need not make any apology, but for my self, that I did only name the books, and not more largely deliver their several titles and subjects, that would have swell'd the catalogue: to supply which if any that desire to be acquainted with the particulers, upon repairing or sending to me, may have full satisfaction from the books themselves, if they send before they are sold.
