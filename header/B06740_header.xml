      <title>The wanton vintner, and the subtile damosel, being an account of a young blade who needs would be dabling with his maid servant, to which she seemed to agree, but went directly and informed her mistriss, who resolved to prove the truth of this matter her own self; so away she went to the place appointed, being the vault, but her husband in the mean time sent another to toy with his maid, so by his own contrivance he hornified his own pate, his wife in the dark supposing it to be her own husband. To the tune of, The doubting virgin.</title>
