      <title>The loyal city of Bristol vindicated from Amsterdamism, or Devil's-borough, two appellatives occasioned by the over credulous, who have taken it for granted, that the schismaticks and hereticks of all sorts were more numerous than the truly loyal, orthodox, and liege people there. But at a late tryal of skill, managed by the more vigilant, and worthy angel-guardian of that city, the point has been lately clear'd, and the church-men for an Earl have out voted the fanaticks for a knight, though to little purpose: for they have rallied again, since the dissolution, to fetch in the same persons. But who? or what? and how equipp'd this ensuing letter (to an utopian prelate) will fully inform you.</title>
