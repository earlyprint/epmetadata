      <title>The humble petition and representation of the sufferings of several peaceable, and innocent subjects, called by the name of Anabaptists, inhabitants in the county of Kent, and now prisoners in the goal of Maidstone, for the testimony of a good conscience. Together with their free and faithful acknowledgement of the King's authority and dignity in civil things, over all manner of persons, ecclesiastical and civil, within His Majesties dominions. With their reasons, meriting the King's protection in their civil and spiritual rights, equal with other His Majesties obedient subjects. Humbly offered to the King's Majesty, and the consideration of our fellow brethren and subjects. Well worthy general observation.</title>
