      <title>Here is the swearers and they who swear falsly, and likewise they who compel men to swear, all tried by the law of the spirit of life which is in Chirst Jesus. Which law is holy, just, pure, and good; and all of them found guilty of sin and transgression against the true and living God; and also sentence pronounced against them all, that so transgress the Law of God, who with the wicked, and all they who forget God, must be turned into Hell, except they repent speedily; for with God there is no respect of persons in Judgement. Written the 21. day of the third month, 1661. by me Henry Clark.</title>
