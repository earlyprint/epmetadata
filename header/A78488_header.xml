      <title>Certaine propositions, whereby the distressed Protestants of Ireland, who have lost their goods, and personall estates there, by means of the present rebellion, may be relieved, if His Maiesty and both Houses of Parliament shall so think fit. And, those that shall be imployed as officers, or common souldiers in this present war, after the war shall be ended, may have lands and tenements alotted unto them there also, for their future settlements: whereby His Majesties revenue also in that realm will be much advanced, and the said kingdom, the better and more speedier peopled, secured, and civillized.</title>
