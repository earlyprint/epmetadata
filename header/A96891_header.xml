      <title>A good souldier, maintaining his militia, and posturing himself, as the servants of the Lord, now and in all ages have postured the kingdomes; wherein the right-hand of the Lord with his servants directing their way, and blessing their worke; and all His ordinances, fasting, praying, preaching, &amp;c. unto the nation; is declared as mightily, as it was by the resurrection from the dead, whether we respect a nation or a man only. Here is a register of Gods blessings and Satans curses; a record of the (megaleia,) the great and admiral salvations, which God has wrought for the (Righteous) nation, and the man there: And of the terrible things Hee has done against His adversaries these foure last yeares. Humbly presented to the House of Parliament and Assembly of Divines. With a discovery of the loyall convert, that he is quite turned from his God, his King and his kingdome: a most disloyall person to all three.</title>
