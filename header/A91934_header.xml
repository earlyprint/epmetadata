      <title>Jegar-Sahadvtha: an oyled pillar. Set up for posterity, against present wickednesses, hypocrisies, blasphemies, persecutions and cruelties of this serpent power (now up) in England (the out-street of the beast.) Or, A heart appeale to heaven and earth, broken out of bonds and banishment at last, in a relation of some part of the past and present sufferings of John Rogers in close prison and continued banishment, for the most blessed cause and testimony of Jesus; the sound of the seventh trumpet and the gospel of the seven thunders, or holy oracles (called rayling by them in power) sealed up to the time of the end. From Carisbrook Castle in the third year of my captivity, the fifth-prison, and the third in exile, having been hurried about from post to pillar, quia perdere nolo substantiam propter accidentia.</title>
