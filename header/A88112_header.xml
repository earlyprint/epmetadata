      <title>Arithmetick: vulgar, decimal, instrumental, algebraical. In four parts: conteining I Vulgar arithmetick, both in whole numbers and fractions, in a most plain and easie method. II Decimal arithmetick, with the ground and reason thereof, illustrated by divers examples. III Instrumental arithmetick, exactly performing all questions of what nature soever in a decimal way, by scales, with much more ease and facility then can be effected, either by vulgar or decimal arithmetick, the work of reduction being wholly avoided. Nothing in this kind having been hitherto published by any. IV Algebraical arithmetick, conteining an abridgement of the precepts of that art, and the use thereof, illustrated by examples and questions of divers kinds. Whereunto is added the construction and use of several tables of interest and annuities, weights and measures, both of our own and other countries. / By William Leybourn.</title>
