      <title>A brief confession or declaration of faith set forth by many of us, who are (falsely) called Ana-baptists, to inform all men (in these dayes of scandal and reproach) of our innocent belief and practise; for which we are not only resolved to suffer persecution, to the loss of our goods, but also life it self, rather than to decline the same. Subscribed by certain elders, deacons, and brethren, met at London, in the first month (called March, 1660.) in the behalf of themselves, and many others unto whom they belong, in London, and in several counties of this nation, who are of the same faith with us.</title>
