          <note>Authorship of the Eikon basilike was originally attributed to Charles I, but according to Madan (pp. 125-33) it was written by John Gauden who probably included some authentic writings of the king.</note>
          <note>This is a reprint of chapter 27 of the Eikon, with the addition of the prayers, set up directly from edition 29 of the Eikon, printed by Mathew Simmons. The initials SKG in imprint are probably invented. -- Madan.</note>
