      <title>A declaration of the bountiful loving-kindness of the Lord manifested to His hand-maid Mary Harris, who stood idle in the market-place, till the eleventh hour, yet afterwards received her penny : this is that none might despair : also a discovery of her sufferings through her disobedience and rebellion against God's precious truth, that none might presume, or harden their hearts in the day of God's visitation : as also, a few words of encouragement from experience, to any who knows the name of the Lord in the least measure, to fear the Lord, and trust in his mercies.</title>
