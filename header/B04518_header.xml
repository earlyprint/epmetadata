A country lass who many suitors had, some good, some mean, the worst of them not bad; a weaver, taylor, shoo-maker, first came, vvith many more of ample note and fame: a barber, baker, miller, and the like, yet unto none of those her sails she'd strike: but in a rustick she is only pleas'd, a plowman only has her fancy eas'd. To the tune of, There was a lass in Cumberland, &amp;c.</title>
