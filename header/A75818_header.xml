          <note>The title page is conjugate with a leaf with signature-mark [sec.] which contains "Rules and directions concerning suspention from the sacrament of the Lords Supper in cases of ignorance", a reprinting of the ordinance. These two leaves possibly were intended to cancel the separate dated title page on A1 which lacks the words "contained in an ordinance .. October 1645.".</note>
          <note>Running title reads: Directions for communicants.</note>
          <note>Annotation on Thomason copy: "Jan: 15 1646"; the 7 in the imprint date has been crossed out.</note>
