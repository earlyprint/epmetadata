      <title>Black Munday turn'd white: or, the astrologers knavery epitomized. Being an answer to the great prognosticks, and gross predictions of Mr. Lillie, Mr. Culpeper, and the rest of the society of astrologers, concerning the eclipse of the sun, on Munday last, which (according to their calculation) should have produced an Egyptian darkness, and the greatest that hath been seen in this latter age. Also, a description of the glorious effects, and happy times, that are to proceed from the two famous luminaries of the sun and moon, upon the aforesaid eclipse; prophetically deduced from the wonderful despensations of that divine power, who drew back the clouds like a curtain, and caused the sun to shew its pleasant beams, to the memorable confutations of these great astrologers.</title>
