      <title>False judgments reprehended and a just reproof to Tho. Everndon, and his associates and fellow-travellers, for the false and rash judgment T.E. gave against G.K. and his faithful Friends and brethren, at the publick meeting at Philadelphia, the 27. of 10. mon. 1692. And also for their bringing with them their paquet of letters (Saul-like to Damascus) containing the false judgment of a faction of men, calling themselves the Yearly-Meeting at Tredaven in Maryland the 4 of 8. mon 92. And another false judgment contained in another letter from William Richardson, all which will return upon their own heads.</title>
