      <title>A few words occasioned by a paper lately printed, stiled, A discourse concerning the Quakers. Together with a call to magistrates, ministers, lawyers, and people to repentance. Wherein all men may see, that the doctrine and life of those people whom the world scornefully calls Quakers, is the very doctnrie [sic] and life of Christ. Written for the sake of the simple minded ones, who are willing to follow Christ under the crosse, and to deny all things to be his disciples. By a servant of the Lord, reproached by the world, and carnall worshippers, under the name of a Quaker; whose name in the flesh is Iames Nayler.</title>
