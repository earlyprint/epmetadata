As also for fluxes, rheumes, collicks, ruptures, and many other infirmities, or any cold diseases; and for those that in beds, studies, shops, ships, churches or elsewhere have need of heat, yet cannot conveniently make use of fire. And likewise for the poor, when having no fire of their own, they may borrow the heating of this stone at a neighbours fire, if his charity be not altogether cold. Published by Sir Richard Carew Barronet, for the honour of God from whom every good gift comes, and for the good of all people, from the new-born babe to the decrepit and decaying old man.</title>
