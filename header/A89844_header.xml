      <title>The power and glory of the Lord shining out of the north, or The day of the Lord dawning: wherein the true light is holden forth to all who desire to walk in the day. With a warning to the people of England of all sorts, not to oppose Christ in his kingdom. Shewing also the way how all flesh comes to know the Lord and fear him, by his terrible shaking the earthly part in man, witnessed by the holy men of God in Scripture. With a word to the serpents seed, or ministers of Antichrist, or man of sin, wherever he is found. By one whom the Lord hath called out of this dark world, into the true light, whom Ismaels brood calls a Quaker, whose name in the flesh is James Nayler.</title>
