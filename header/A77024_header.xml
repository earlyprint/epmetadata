      <title>Hidden things revealed and brought to light: or, Plain and honest dealing with Will. Lamboll &amp; John Buy, of Reading in the county of Berks, in some material queries proposed to them to be answered, &amp;c. With the rest of those that were instrumental (in too large a degree) of the former or first separation wrought among Friends here in this town, and who are found still as instrumental for the upholding and continuance of the same, by their not returning with other Friends to the ancient publick meeting-house, the doors thereof having been opened ever since the 10th of the 9th month, 1693. which is now about 9 months since, for all Friends to meet together therein, as a peaceable Christian society ought to do, in the true love, fear and worship of almighty God, that so there might be no longer two divided publick meetings held and kept up in this town, both to the great reproach of truth, and stumbling of many of the tender inquiries after it.</title>
