      <title>Innocency, though under a cloud, cleared By P.H. a poor prisoner, when almost sunk under pretended friends censures in the day of his sufferings. And also, a discovery of the comforts that attends innocency in a prison. As also, twenty four usefull particulars left by him for his children and friends, and being left in a friends hand for his relations, I could not but make them publick; judging it will be no loss to the author, and great gain to the reader, and justly give offence to none.</title>
