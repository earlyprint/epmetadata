      <title>The excise-mens lamentation: or, an impeachment in behalf of the Commons of this nation, against their insulting publicans, and cruell oppressors and extortioners: with their acknowledgment, confession, and testimony, touching their proceedings in each county; and the vast and mighty summes vvich they most wickedly retained: collected by their unlimited power, spungie hearts, and long-stretched consciences. Also, the rising of the Welch-men against a party of them at Monmouth; and the manner how Mr. Crow (the farmer of excise) ran naked into a tub of feathers; where, after a short time, he was taken, and a great oath and charge inflicted upon him. Published for information of the people.</title>
