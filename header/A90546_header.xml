      <title>The speech and confession of Hugh Peters, close prisoner in the Tower of London; and his horrible expressions and doctrine, when our glorious Soveraign was led to martyrdome. With the manner how he was taken on Sunday night last in Southwark; who to save himself, crept into bed to one Mrs. Peach a Quaker, which had lain in child-bed two days. And afterwards escaped to the house of Mrs Mun, where he was taken, with divers pieces of gold, and silver medals, sewed in his skirts; and a strange almanack taken out of his pocket.</title>
