      <title>The sinners arraignment; or, The life, death and judgment of stubborn and incorrigible sinners Wherein first is plainly set forth and described the certainty of their death: as also many pithy arguments to perswade men to prepare for it, lest they fall unawares into the great condemnation. Together with a pithy discourse of the last and great judgment, with a discovery of the judge, the judged, and the manner of the pronouncing sentence, the confusion of sinners before the judgement seat, being full of terrour and amazement; as also followed on with many directions to sinners. which, if followed, they may escape the sentence of, Go ye cursed, &amp;c. With some consolations for saints, who have overcome the second death, and may appear with boldnesse at the great day and receive their sentence of, Come ye blessed, &amp;c. By T.P.</title>
