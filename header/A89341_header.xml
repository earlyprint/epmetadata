      <title>The necessity of Christian subjection. Demonstrated, and proved by the doctrine of Christ, and the Apostles; the practice of primitive Christians, the rules of religion, cases of conscience, and consent of latter orthodox divines, that the power of the King is not of humane, but of divine right; and that God onely is the efficient cause thereof. Whereunto is added, an appendix of all the chief objections that malice it selfe could lay upon His Majestie, with a full answer to every particular objection. Also a tract intituled, Christus Dei, wherein is proved that our Soveraign Lord the King is not onely major singulis, but major universis.</title>
