      <title>A collection of experience of the work of grace: (never before printed.) Or The Spirit of God working upon the souls of several persons whereby is demonstrated their conversion to Christ, or signs of being in the peculiar love of God to salvation. Published, not to applaud the persons, but for the comfort of saints, both the new-born in Christ and the beclouded-believer, may here see that it hath been with the souls of other saints as with theirs: and also it being matter of fact, may convince the unregenerate that there is indeed such a thing as the working of the Spirit of God upon the soul, &amp;c. Collected by Charles Doe.</title>
