      <title>England's fair warning to a speedy repentance: being an earnest exhortation to a holy life: or The only deliverer from eternal death and destruction Wherein is plainly laid down the great duty of speedy repentance; with the wretched state of a sinner, and the blessed state of a saint: shewing how the one (after death) will be cast for ever into the dreadful flames of Hell-fire: and the other will be received up into Heaven, to celebrate eternal halelujah's to the Lord of Lords, who (sitting at the right-hand of his father) will shortly come to judge the world. Likewise, some pithy arguments to persuade men to close with Christ. Preached by R. Liford, a B.D. since the dreadful earthquakes that have lately happen'd; ... And now published, to awaken drowsie sinners, who still lye in security, whilst God's judgements are on the earth.</title>
