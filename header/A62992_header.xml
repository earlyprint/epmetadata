      <title>A letter to Mr. Mead, in answer to several unscriptural, and unsound sayings of his in a sermon against the seventh-day-sabbath, preached at his place of meeting, the twenty third of the second month. 1682. Wrote the same day the sermon was preached, refuting his arguments, and turning them back, making their unskilfulness and weakness manifest; and clearly evidencing, that the seventh-day is the sabbath day; by clear scripture-testimony, and sound arguments grounded thereon. Published for his hearers, because he would neither hear an objection in publick, nor admit of a conference in private.</title>
