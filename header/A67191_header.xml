      <title>Tactometria. Seu, Tetagmenometria. Or, The geometry of regulars practically proposed after a new, most artificial, exact and expeditious manner (together with the natural or vulgar, by way of mensurall comparison) and in the solids, not only in respect of magnitude or dimension, but also of gravity of ponderosity, according to any metal assigned. ... And withall, the like artificial practical geometry of regular-like solids (as I term them) in both the foresaid respects: and moreover, of a cylindricall body, for liquid or vessell-measure (commonly called by the name of gauging) as is for solid measure; ... And lastly, an A-tactometrie, or an appendix, for the most ready and exact discovering of the dimensionall quantity of any irregular kind of body, ... A work very usefull and delightfull for all such as are either ingenuously studious of, or necessarily exercised and employed in the practice of the art metricall. By J.W.</title>
