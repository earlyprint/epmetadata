          <note>In this edition (probably the later), the portrait of Charles I has no background and there is a small execution scene at upper left. There are 8 lines of engraved verse below, the first line reading "But lo a charg is drawne a day is set". Another edition, probably earlier and with title and text partly in a different setting, has an entirely different portrait of Charles I with cross-hatched background and a skull on a stand to the right at shoulder level. There are 8 lines of type-set verse under the portrait with first line reading "Weep England weep, help all to raise loud cry". In the earlier edition, line 4 of title begins "And also of those thirty five witnesses sworne" and the list of witnesses contains 35 names. In this later edition, line 4 of title begins "And also of those witnesses sworne" and the list of witnesses contains 30 names.</note>
