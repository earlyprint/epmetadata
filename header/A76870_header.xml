      <title>A bloudy fight in France, between the Kings army, commanded by General Harcourt, the King of Scots, and the Duke of York; and the Prince of Conde's Forces, on Christmas Day last. With the manner how the said Duke led on the forlorn hope, fell upon the Princes forces, gave the first onset; and after a gallant charge, (seconded by his brother the King) routed them, and beat them out of their trenches. With the number killed and taken prisoners, most of their ordnance, armes, and ammunition, and two other armies entring the field, under the command of the King of Poland's son, and Prince Edward.</title>
