      <title>To the birth of God in all the sanctified, the church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven who are born again, not of the will of the flesh, but of God's Holy Spirit: you to whom is given the white stone, and the new name, that none knows but he that hath it, who as living stones are laid in the walls (not of the Jerusalem that now is, and is in bondage with her children, but) of the new Jerusalem that is above, (in the heart and throne of God) which is free, and is the mother of us all. To you, however you are divided, or where-ever ye are lodg'd, and held in the clifts of the rocks, in Dens and caves of the earth, or secret places of the stars; under all your divided tribes, Robert Rich sendeth greeting in our Lord God everlasting. Allelujah.</title>
