          <note>Includes bibliographical references.</note>
          <note>Apparently based in part on Arnoldus Montanus's "De Nieuwe en onbekende weereld: of beschryving van American en 't zuid-land," which was granted copyright privileges in July, 1670, and published in Amterdam in 1671. Sabin, who records an edition of Obilby as bearing date of 1670, says: "This English translation is, like Dapper's 'an impudent plagiarism' from Montanus, plates included." In the text many changes and additions were made by Ogilby, and his maps of Maryland, Jamaica and Barbados are not found in Montanus. The general map of America in Ogilby also differs materially from that in the Dutch work.</note>
