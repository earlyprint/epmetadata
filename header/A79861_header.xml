With an exhortation to the people of England; to forsake them, their blind-guides, and to follow Christ Iesus, the shepard of their souls; the way, the truth, and life, who faith, come learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, ... / Given forth to undeceive the simple hearted; by him whose name in the flesh, is, Henry Clark.</title>
