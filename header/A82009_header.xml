      <title>The communicants instructor. Or, A sacramental catechism in which the nature of the covenant of grace, and the visible seals thereof (viz.) baptism and the Lord's Supper, with the gospel qualifications of worthy receivers, are opened with all plainness and clearness by way of question and answer. Recommended to the use of the younger and more ignorant sort, especially to such as desire admission to, and would worthily partake of the Lord's Supper; with a request to the charitable, that they would make it a piece of their spiritual alms to the poor. By George Day, Minister of the gospel.</title>
