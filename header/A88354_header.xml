      <title>The Lambs defence against lyes. And a true testimony given concerning the sufferings and death of James Parnell. And the ground thereof. By such hands as were eye-witnesses, and have subscribed their names thereto. Set forth for no other end, but to clear the innocent from the back-biters, and to undeceive the simple, least they bring guilt upon themselves by joyning with bloody men, and so partake of their plagues. Also a touch of some few of the unmeasurable sufferings of this present age, that all that will see may see, and understand, though evill men grow worse and worse. Set forth from those people scorned and persecuted under the name of Quakers.</title>
