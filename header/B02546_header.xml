      <title>Cupids golden dart, or, A dainty sonnet here is to be sold, the like whereof was never sung nor told: of a brave girl that had a bag of gold, which she delivered into her sweet-hearts hold. And now they live together lovingly, in joy, in peace, and true tranquility: at first they seem'd to be at mortal strife, but in conclusion were made man and wife. Tune is, Down in an arbour devouted to Venus.</title>
