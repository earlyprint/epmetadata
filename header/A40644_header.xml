          <note>Annotation on Thomason copy: on title page, after 'Crumwell': "wch is a false letter in ye conclusion of it"; "June 17th"; on page 3: text is circled beginning with 'Honest men served you faithfully ..', and annotated "all this is added and not his owne" [Thomason was wrong; the conclusion is Cromwell's. See Abbott, "Writings and speeches of Oliver Cromwell", v.1, p.360; for letter without conclusion see "An ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament" (Wing E2072)].</note>
