      <title>Englands unthankfulness striving with Gods goodness, for the victory as Abaslom [sic] strove with David, whether the father should be more kinde to the son; or the son more unkinde to the father. Or, enough (being wel weighed) to melt an heart of adamant. By R. Younge, florilegus. In reference to Leviticus 19.17 and Isaiah 58.1. In reading whereof, reflect upon your selves; hearken to conscience; and what concerns you, apply it to others, as David did Nathans parable, 2 Sam. 12.1, to 8. And Ahab the prophets, 1 King.20. 39, to 43. Want of application makes all means ineffectual; and therefore are we Christians in name only, because we think out selves Christians indeed, and already good enough.</title>
