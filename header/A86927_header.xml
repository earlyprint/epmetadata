      <title>The husbandmans plea against tithes. Or, Two petitions presented unto the House of Commons assembled in Parliament: by divers freeholders, and other freemen of Hertfordshire, with the parts adjacent of Bedford and Buckinghamshires for the taking away of tithes. And the matter of the said petitions is reduced unto two propositions, or generall heads, and reasons to confirm them. And also the said petitioners answers unto certain objections made by the ministers and impropriators that would continue tithes upon the husbandman. Published by some of the said petitioners whose names are set down in the latter end of this book, for the vindication of themselves and their fellows, from the reproach cast upon them by the writer of a book, intituled, Plain English, &amp;c. Printed 1646. And the reproach cast upon them by the author of another book, intituled, Tithes re-mounted, &amp;c.</title>
