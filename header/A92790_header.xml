      <title>A seasonable caution to apostate Protestants: or, mercy and judgment at once visible wherein you'l find heart refreshing mercy to the firm Protestants; and soul ruining vengeance on the rotten time-serving ones that turn papists. Verifying, in the very letter, that promise, whosoever will save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it: Mat. 16. 25. (as here the true Protestants did, who gave themselves up for dead men, rather than turn papists to save their lives; and yet were miraculously saved: when, at the same time, the rotten unsound Protestants, who, at that pinch, turn'd papists to save their lives, yet perished. Written by Mercurius Hibernicus, an ey-witness of the Protestants miseries, and of the papists treacheries in Ireland; from whom expect several sheets to the shame of popery.</title>
