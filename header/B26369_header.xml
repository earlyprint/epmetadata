      <title>The exchequer gallon vindicated to be the true and only standard gallon of England Against the unjust calumnies in a pamphlet, entituled, The cry of the oppressed, by reason of false measures. Written in behalf of the Commonwealth. Wherein is manifested, that the brewers are not forced to sell by one measure, and pay excise by another, as they pretend they are. But their vessels are gauged by that only standard gallon which is commanded to be used throughout the nation by Acts of Parliament in force, made by this and many precedent Parliaments; which gallon by those Acts is also appointed to be and remain for a standard in the Treasury or Exchequer for ever; to the end no deceit might be used by variety of measures in this nation. By John Lyon, Professor of Mathematicks, and a well-wisher of publique good.</title>
