      <title>Pelagos. Nec inter vivos, nec inter mortuos, neither amongst the living, nor amongst the dead. Or, An improvement of the sea, upon the nine nautical verses in the 107. Psalm; wherein is handled I. The several, great, and many hazzards, that mariners do meet withall, in stormy and tempestuous seas. II. Their many, several, miraculous, and stupendious deliverances out of all their helpless, and shiftless distressess [sic]. III. A very full, and delightful description of all those many various, and multitudinous objects, which they behold in their travels (through the Lords Creation) both on sea, in sea, and on land. viz. all sorts and kinds of fish, foul, and beasts, whether wilde, or tame; all sorts of trees, and fruits; all sorts of people, cities, towns, and countries; with many profitable, and useful rules, and instructions for them that use the seas. / By Daniel Pell, preacher of the Word.</title>
