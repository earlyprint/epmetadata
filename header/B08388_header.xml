      <title>As it is very much the Parliaments honour, so we account it no lesse our happinesse, that the doors thereof stands so freely open, wherein we may present our desires, as also acquaint it with such fears and grievances, as for the present we do, or for the future may suspect to suffer under. And as for the full discovery of both, we have presented our severall petitions, so we think ourselves in duty obliged to tender our hearty and thankefull acknowledgements, for that returne for the present we received by the mouths of those two worthy gentlemen Sir Henry Vane and Col. Lister. Not doubting but that we shall suddenly finde our hopes crowned with such further answer, as the merits of so just and honest a case deserves. In the mean time, we cannot but to our great regreet take notice of a false and scandalous paper, put in by Sir William Killigrew, miscalling our humble and mode it addresses, clamours, our appearances riots. A strange mistaken confidence, so foully indeavouring to abuse their credulity, from whom he expects to finde favour or authority.</title>
