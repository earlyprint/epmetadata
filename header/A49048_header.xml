Giving a true account of a wench, who being with-child, laid it to seven journey-men taylors, who at length was forc'd to contribute each man his penny a day to defray this extraordinary charge; with other circumstances which this had like to have incurred upon the seven distressed journey-men taylors: this being published for the good of all journey-men taylors, lest they unhappily do fall in the like distress.
