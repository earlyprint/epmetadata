      <title>To all persons that have any sense of the reality of vertue in the pursuit of my design to demonstrate, that the people called Quakers, deserve more favour from the Church of England, than any other sort of dissenters. I shall here recite some passages in the Book of common-prayer, to which they acknowledge, that it is their duty, and that in Christ they have a power, to conform themselves in the whole course of their lives. / By Edmund Elys.</title>
