      <title>Anti-Merlinus: or a confutation of Mr. William Lillies predictions for this year 1648. comprised in two bookes : one of which he cals Merlinus Anglicus, or An ephimeris : the other his Prognostication of the occurences in England, clearely proveing his predictions in both bookes to be groundlesse, absolutely void of art, full of contradictions, treason, falsehood, and such a ridiculous piece of foolery, as an artist would blush to owne, especially pretending (as he doth) to ground his predictions upon cacodemologie, or conference with devils, and lapsed angels, as well as on astrologie, an art lawfull and laudable. As also the authors own opinion, not only concerning what we may expect from the present treaty, and the principall occurences of the remaining part of this present year, but also his positive judgement touching the event and finall determination of this Civill War, succinctly set downe, together with his reasons in art therefore. / By H. Johnsen student in astrologie.</title>
