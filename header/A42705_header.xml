      <title>A faithfull testimony for the Lord wherein is proclaimed the mighty day of his power. Also, an exhortation of love unto all young children, with young men and maidens, whose hearts are tender towards the Lord. By one whom it pleased the Lord to manifest himself unto now in the dayes of my youth, and hath given me cause never to forget him, whom it pleased to call me from amongst my relations, to bear testimony unto his name, when I was about eleven years of age.</title>
