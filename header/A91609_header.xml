      <title>A brief treatise containing a full discovery 1. Of Cæsars politique state, or civill government, 2. Of the divine politique state, or kingdome of Christ Jesus, given him of his father. 3. Of the devilish politique state or kingdome of Antichrist. Laid open in the essentiall and main circumstantiall parts of each body or state by substantiall and fundamentall reasons and principles of policy both divine and humane, and confirmed by holy Scripture. Whereby the great and intolerable grievances of Christ Jesus and his subjects are made knowne: also how honourable magistracy and civill government is, and how farre it extends, without intrenching upon the prerogative of Christ, doth evidently appear in this treatise. Humbley presented to the serious consideration of the Kings most excellent Majesty, and the high court of Parliament now assembled. By Michael Quintine.</title>
