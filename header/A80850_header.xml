More particularly in relation to some sinnes, viz. blasphemy, adultery, &amp;c. Occasionally handled in a controversie betweene the said publike professor T.C. and Doctor Whitgift. Here also by the way is laid downe his judgment in the case of divorce, and that the party innocent may marrie again.</title>
