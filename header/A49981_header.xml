Wherein is shewed the great contradictions of the Quakers, both in their former and later writings. Also how they deny Jesus of Nazareth to be the Christ. And how in Pensilvania and there-away, where they have the government in their own hands, they hire and encourage men to fight; and how they persecute, fine, imprison, and take away goods for conscience sake. Notwithstanding they formerly exclaimed against the government of England, &amp;c. for the same things. Setting forth likewise there base temporizing with whatever government is uppermost, &amp;c.
