      <title>Joco-serio. Strange news, of a discourse between two dead giants expressed in an epigram, to one inquisitive for news, and was composed by occasion of a scurrilous pamphlet, entituled, A dialogue between Colbrant and Brandamore, the two giants in Guild-hall London. Which pamphlet was not only intended to abuse this author, and some particular persons by name, but the said city also, in the late election of their Parliamentary Members. Thereto is added an antidote against all ill news whatsoever, which proving effectual to many lately reputed phanaticks, may possibly be vertual to some other. Jeers will be self-condemned, and stingless if contemned. G. W.</title>
