      <title>A few proposals offered in humility and in the spirit of meekness, to the supreme authority, the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England. Holding forth a medium or essay for the removing of tythes, and establishing a maintenance for a godly ministry in the nation: such as may be satisfying to the consciences of all sober-minded men, and injurious to no mans just propriety or interest. Which were some time since presented to the Parliament, by several well-affected people in the county of Suffolk; and now published by a well-wisher to England's peace, and the Gospel's prosperity.</title>
