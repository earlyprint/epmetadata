      <title>A relation of a disputation between Dr Griffith and Mr Vavasor Powell. And since some false observations made thereon, by Dr Griffith (or one of his symonicall brethren) to keep up the crack'd credit of their bad calling and cause. As also to reflect upon Mr Moston (whom they suppose to be the author of that relation) Mr Powell, and others. This therefore is to shew briefly the falsitie of those animadversions: and withall to justifie that syllogisme (objected against by him) by good authors, examples and arguments.</title>
