      <title>To the Pope and all his magistrates and the Protests here they and all Christendom may see the moderation of the heathen emperours to the Christians in the 650 years before there was a Pope, signified by their letters following in the behalf of the Christians liberty which will rise up in judgment against the Popes and their emperours and his magistrates and most of the Protestants, as here you may see in the reading of their declarations and the straitnesse of the orders of those called Christians now, and the largeness of the heathens then, as concerning liberty in the spirit to worship God : and also here you may see the heathen were more moderate to the Christians then the Christians, so called, are to one another : taken out of the ten persecutions.</title>
