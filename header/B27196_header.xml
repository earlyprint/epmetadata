      <title>[Hebrew] Peace-offerings and lamentations being the tears of a compunctionated and compassionate spirit, shed over the pale and cunsumptive face of heart-sick England, issuing as from the bleeding heart of a son over his languishing mother. Exprest in an antidote against her present plague, in an alexipharmacum against her too too epidemical pestilence. Written, intentionally only, by way of letter to his friend; but, though as a ruch candle, unbushel'd at last, as its contents required. By C.N. a fool for Christ.</title>
