          <note>A Lover of the Truth = Carew Raleigh. Sometimes also attributed to Peter Heylyn.</note>
          <note>Carew Raleigh was the only surviving son of Sir Walter Raleigh. This work is in reply to "A compleat history of the lives and reigns of Mary Queen of Scotland, and of her son and successor, James the Sixth, King of Scotland; and (after Queen Elizabeth) King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, the First, (of ever blessed memory.)" by Sir William Sanderson (Wing S647). In his observations, Carew Raleigh notes that his father had loaned "great sums of money" to Sanderson's father. On his release from the Tower the elder Raleigh requested repayment and was forced to file suit against the elder Sanderson. Sanderson was "found in arrears to Sir Walter Raleigh in very great sums, was cast into prison, and there dyed a poor contemptible beggar".</note>
