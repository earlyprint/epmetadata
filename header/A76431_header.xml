      <title>The Berkshire lady's garland: in four parts Cupid's conquest over a coy lady of five thousand a year, who having slighted many noble offers, was compell'd by Cupid, to wed a poor country attorney. The Lady's letter of challenge to fight her upon refusing to wed her in a mask, without knowing who she was. How they met by appointment in a grove, where she oblig'd him to fight or wed her; he con[sen]ted to the latter, took her for better or worse! How they rid together in her gilded coach, to her noble seat or castle, where she plac'd him in a room, an left him some hours alone. And with other things worthy of note.</title>
