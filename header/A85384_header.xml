Or, arguments and grounds as well in reason as religion, clearly evincing the unlawfulnesse of those ordinances or commissions (at least as they have been from time to time declared and interpreted, aloud by the persons acting them, and tacitly by the authority enacting them) with all others of like import, by which the respective courts, or consistories of triers and ejectors (so called) amongst us, are established: together with the unwarrantablenesse of the acceptation and exercise of the powers delegated and granted in the said commissions, by any man, or company of men whatsoever, now in being. By John Goodwin, an aged minister of Jesus Christ, and pastor to that remnant of his sheep, usually assembling in Coleman-street, London.</title>
