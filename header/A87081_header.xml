      <title>The clergies lamentation: deploring the sad condition of the kingdome of Ireland, by reason of the unparallel'd cruelties and murders exercised by the inhumane popish rebells upon many thousand Protestants in the Province of Ulster, and especially the ministers there, since the beginning of this bloudy rebellion. In which is also particularly expressed the names, and manner of the murthering, imprisoning and famishing of such ministers and others, by those barbarous and blood-thirsty rebells. Published as an incouragement to all true-borne Englishmen, to rise up as one man to resist those rebells, who are (by command from His Majesty) shortly to be brought over into England. By Daniel Harcourt, one of the commissioners for the examination of the Protestants grievances in that province. Published by order.</title>
