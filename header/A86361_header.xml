      <title>A New-Years-gift for women. Being a true looking-glass which they seldome have in their own closets, where (for the most part) are none but flattering ones: but hereby, and herein, they may truly, plainly, and directly, see their duties, both towards God, and their own husbands. With an epistle dedicatory, directed to the feminine gender (never done before) nor the like extant in no printed book. However, many have dedicated to one or two vertuous ladies, upon some good reasons moving the author thereunto. But never any (as this is) to the whole sex of women, of what rank or quality soever they be.</title>
