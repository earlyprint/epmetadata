      <title>The Ranters reasons resolved to nothing. Or, the fustification instead of the justification of the Mad Crew Being, a serious answer returned to one who in his letter desired an unlawfull and wicked book to be sent unto him, call'd the Justification of the Mad Crew. Instead of vvhich, the author of this letter sent him the Act of Parliament made against the Ranters; and did also both justifie their way, and ingratefully asperse some, who in Christian love would have reduced them to the life and truth of Christianity. Wherein the people called by themselves god and by some others, the Gods of Godmanchester, may, as in a glasse, behold, that they are a deluded and defiled people, if not incarnate Devils.</title>
