      <title>Fair Lucina conquered by prevailing Cupid. She that triumphed in disdain, at last was forc'd to yield, and of her self she thus complain'd when Cupid wonn the field: though at the first I was unkind, yet now I'le loving be, and that my Coridon shall find if he'l return to me. When Coridon did hear these words, he did most joyfully embrace his kind, and dearest love; and they did both agree. To the tune of, Jenny Gin. or, The fair one let me in.</title>
