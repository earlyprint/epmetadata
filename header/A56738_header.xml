      <title>A view of the world, being a poem of the times containing the root of rebellion, the tree of sedition, the leaves of contention, and the fruit of treason : [a]dvising every good Christian to obey governours and superiors, and not to kick at every occasion, nor to make a schism and rent in the church at every scruple, criticism, and mistake, but to live in peace and unity, lest (being found imposters before God and rebels to their King) their heads be mounted on a pole as a fruit of their treachery and rebellion.</title>
