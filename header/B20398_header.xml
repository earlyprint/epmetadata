      <title>The Quakers downfal with all other dispensations their inside turn'd outward : wherein you have it infallibly interpreted 1. What Scripture is, what not, 2. By whom it was writ, 3. For whom it was writ, 4. The end wherefore it was writ : also a brief narration of the Quakers conference with us the second of July 1659 wherein we made appear that all their  sufferings in New-England, or any other nation, they suffer justly as evil doers so that neither they nor their persecutors so living and so dying shall escape damnation : with a clear confutation of all Armenians (called free-willers) that deny Gods prerogative power in matter of damnation and salvation / written by Laurence Claxton.</title>
