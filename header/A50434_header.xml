      <title>The history and mystery of the venereal lues concisely abstracted and modelled (occasionally) from serious strict perpensions, and critical collations of divers repugning sentiments and contrary assertions of eminent physicians: English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian dissenting writers. Convincing by argument and proof the traditional notions touching this grand evil, and common reputed practice grounded thereon, as erroneous and unfound. Solving the most dubious and important quæries concerning the abstruse nature, difficult and deceitful cures of this popular malady. With animadversions upon various methods of cure, practised in those several nations. By E. Maynwaringe doctor in Physick.</title>
