      <title>The Scotch souldiers kindness. It being the sorrowful ditty of fifty young damsels of Southwark, who lately lost their maiden-heads with those valiant souldiers lately quartered in that place. Stout souldiers then are valiant men, their fame will ever ring, we may admit that they should get brave souldiers for the King: in warlike fights, both Lords and knights, and valiant souldiers dye, then well may they with damsels play, to get a new supply. To the tune of, The crafty miss. This may be printed, R.L.S. Iune 25.</title>
