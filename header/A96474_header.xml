      <title>Tertia pars De comparatis comparandis: seu justificationis Regis Caroli comparatè, contra Parliamentum. Or, The third part of things compared : or of the justification of King Charles comparatively against the Parliament. Wherein is manifested and fulfilled the discovery that was promised, and left imperfect in the first and second parts of this subject, concerning severall eminent members, in both Houses of Parliament, and their abominable actions, even such as cannot in all respects be parallel'd, in the worst times of the King. With a demonstration of the end wherefore, and the means by which the insupportable tyranny, extortion and oppression of (those tophets and tormentours) gaols and gaolers (the very abstract of all the oppressions of this kingdom) are principally still continued and supported : with many other memorable and remarkable passages, both of information and caution to all the free born commons of England. / By Am: Wilbee.</title>
