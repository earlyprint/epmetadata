Or, the arraignment and sentence of those blood-thirsty and unparallel'd traitors, who contrary to all law and justice, judged and condemned the late Kings Majesty, Charles the First, of glorious memory to death; who by the divine hand of Gods justice, which alwayes pursues and overtakes blood-thirsty traitots [sic] to their ruine aad [sic] destruction, are now to be made publick examples of justice, for that horrid act which is now by both Houses of Parliament declared to be horrid murder. With a perfect list of all their names, whose estates are to be sequestered for the same, for the use of his Majesty.</title>
