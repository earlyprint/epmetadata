      <title>This for the Parliament, Counsel, and the officers of the army of the Common-wealth of England, Scotland and Ireland; in patience to read and consider, Eccle. 7. 8, 9. Hag. 1. 5. Being that the servants of the Lord are to finish their true and faithful testimony against the world, as the Lord shall move them so to do, who live and move in him, that so they may finish their course with joy; and now for this end and purpose have I given forth this my testimony, that I might be found doing the will of God, whom I serve in the Spirit of his Son, not knowing but that my service herein may be acceptable to all, or some of you, and if but to one, shall be glad, and if to none, my labour shall not be in vain in the Lord, who is the reward of all them that obey him and diligently seek him. Written about the middle of the sixth month, 1659. By a lover of the truth, as it is in Jesus, a late member of the army, known by the name of Thomas Davenport</title>
