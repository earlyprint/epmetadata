      <title>The true light hath made manifest darknesse: or, Sion builded up, and Babylon cast downe. With a true answer of what the Baptist teachers objected against the servant of the Lord who in scorn is called a Quaker, and known to the world by the name of Iohn Moon, in several places in VVales, both in Radnorshire, and Breck-nockshire, whose names are these. Hugh Evans, John Price, Daniel Penry, Reese Davies, John Prosser, Evans Oliver, and Vavasor Powel, who are called ministers of the gospel, but are found to be enemies to it. Some of Vavasor Powel's doctrine tryed, and made manifest by the light. And also some queries given forth, and are to be answered by them that lives in observations. This is given forth by me who is a lover of the truth, and known to the world by this name, John Moone.</title>
