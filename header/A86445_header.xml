      <title>A discovery of two unclean spirits. Or, Two priests by their fruits made manifest to be out of the way of truth, and out of the life of godliness, in the broad way of destruction, therein working deceitfully the works of errour. A warning unto all scattered people that call themselves Protestants and Christians, yet are out of the faith and life of Christ, in vain traditions, and dead forms, wherein the blind-guids are leading them in the pit. Also a declaration of the light of Christ now appearing in every man, even in the conscience, by which all men are left without excuse. With a plain and true direction into the good way, which from everlasting hath been prepared to lead all that abide therein, out of transgression through death into eternal life. A short discovery of the Lords great fury and heavie indignation that will suddenly break forth upon all the disobedient. Written by one, who loves the seed of God, which is unknown to the world, A.H. in the county of Gloucester.</title>
