      <title>An antidote against Romes infection: received by the reformed churches beyond the seas, approved by them, and commended to the Church of England: consisting of uniformitie and conformitie in church-government, and the necessity of abolishing some ceremonies lately commanded by the episcopall power, which are rather prejudiciall then materiall to Gods true worship. Also a view of the pious and religious care of the citizens of this citie; who have by all means laboured the extirpation of the causes which have so long troubled the church and common-wealth. Brought over by Philadelphus, and delivered by him to Philalethes, in a discourse; and by him published for the publike benefit.</title>
