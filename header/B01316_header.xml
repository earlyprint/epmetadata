      <title>An account (as near as may be) of the several sums of money lately paid, or payable for the tythes of divers parishes within the city of London, and liberties thereof, where the churches were demolished by the late fire. As also the several sums of money which on the first of December, 1670, were in the Guild-Hall of the said city, consented to, and agreed on by some aldermen and ministers of the said city, as by them thought reasonable to be propounded to the present Parliament, to be established by the authority of the same. Together with reasons why addition should be made to the rates of tythes as they were formerly.</title>
