      <title>The sea-mens invitation, with a passengers observation in some particular things which concern them that practice navigation. 1 Their remarkable deliverances; and the use they make of them. 2 Their tempting and provoking of God about the winde, which obeys the Lord. 3 Their abusing themselves and their liberty when they go a shoar, whereby the creature suffers. 4 Something in particular to the captains and masters, and to all their inferiour officers. 5 How little the sea-men (with the souldiers in the fleet) are profited by their chaplains that in the year do get several groats out of their wages. And a more excellent way of teaching shewn then that of their chaplains. / By a servant of the truth, and a lover of righteousnesse, called William Caton.</title>
