      <title>A trumpet blown in Sion, sounding an alarm in Gods holy mountain: or, A voice lifted up as a trumpet crying aloud, and not sparing, to shew the Lords people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins. By a poor worm, that through the Lords great grace, hath found great blessings among the Presbyterian ministry, and by conversing with some of the Lords upright ones of the Presbyterian way; and also choice blessings among the ministry of the Independant and Baptized congregations, and some of the faithful with them.</title>
