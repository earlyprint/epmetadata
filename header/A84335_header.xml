      <title>An elegie sacred to the immortall memory of the most worthy, and most lamented, John Pym, Esq. Who having done most remarkable service to the state, was on Friday being the 8. of Decemb. 1643. translated from the House of Commons, to the Vpper house of glory, and parliament of angels in heaven. The memory of this never to be forgotten patriot deserveth truely to be observed by every man, who stands well affected to the true religion, the lawes, and liberties both of Parliament and kingdome: his body (both the houses, and the assembly of divines being present) was carried with solemn honour and magnificence by sixe of the House of Commons: the reverend divine, Mr. Stephen Marshall did preach the funerall, who did take his text out of the seventh of Micah, the first and second verses. The words were, The good man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men, &amp;c.</title>
