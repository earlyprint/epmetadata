      <title>Lilly's strange and wonderful prophecy being a relation of many universal accidents that will come to pass in the year 1681. According to the prognostications of the celestial bodies, as well in this our English nation, as in parts beyond the seas : with a sober caution to all by speedy repentance to avert the judgments that are impendent. As likewise a strange and wonderful discovery at a place called Leek, in Stafford-shire : by men digging in the earth for stones to pave two streets, where they found a pavement of smooth stone, several pots of ashes and mens bones ... as also an account of the great stream of light, by some termed a blazing-star, which was seen in the south-west on Saturday and Sunday the 11th and 12th of this instant December, between six and seven in the evening, with sever judicial opinions and conjectures upon the same.</title>
