      <title>The fruits of unrighteousnes and injustice Brought forth by John Bulkley, and Thomas Bowrman, and the rest of the rulers in Hampshire, against the innocent people of God called Quakers. Who in words and writings have often declared their unjust sufferings; as also at two sessions, and two general assizes holden at Winchester, requiring justice and equity, and their right and liberty in the nation; of the which being still most unjustly deprived, it is now publiquely declared, that they and others seeing their deeds of darknesse brought to light, may be warned, and learn to do justice, and to relieve the oppressed. Also the sounding voyce of the dread of Gods mighty power to all the judges and rulers of the earth, who rise up aginst the Lamb, and to all the host of powers of darknesse who fight against God. By the servants of Christ ... called Humphry Smith. Anthony Melledg. George Henderson. James Potter. Will: Baily. Daniel Baker. John Day. Winifred Newman.</title>
