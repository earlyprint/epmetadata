By putting men to the svvord, deflovvring women, and dragging them up and downe the streets, and cruelly murdering them, and thrusting their speeres through their little infants before their eyes, and carrying them up and downe on pike-points, in great reproach, and hanging mens quarters on their gates in the street, at Armagh, Logall, at the Fort of Lease, and divers other places in Ireland. As also, the bloudy acts of Lord Mack-queere their ri[n]g-leader, and cousin to that arch-rebell Mack-queere Generall to Tyron, in the time of Queene Elizabeth of never dying memory. / Related by James Salmon lately come from thence, who hath lived there with his wife and children, these 10 yeeres last past, and now to escape the bloud-thirsty rebels, made an escape away by night, who is here resident in this city, Decemb. the 1. 1641.</title>
