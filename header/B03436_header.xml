Or A caveat against vvenching the proverb old does tell us all you know, as crowes the old cock so the young doth crow, the father does chastize the son for sin, and quite forgets what vice himself liv'd in. The son reflects, pray sir leave off the game, and I'le endeavour for to do the same; the old man hearing this with shame amends: the young one does so too, and both are friends. Tune of, The delights of the bottle.</title>
