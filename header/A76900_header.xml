      <title>Bloudy newes from sea: being a perfect narrative, and exact relation, of the great and desperate engaging, between two hundred sail of English and Dutch-Men of war, upon the coast of Scilley: with the manner how Gen. Blake, and Sir George Ascue, drew their fleet into Battalia; the resolution of the Hollander; and the number of ships taken by the English. Also, the chasing of divers ships to the Downs; the taking of some English by Captain Bradshaw; the sinking of the London Faulcon; the number of ships surprized in Sole-Bay neer Yarmouth; and above one hundred sail of colliers coming into the Downs, bound for London. With the seizing of all the ships and goods belonging to the English merchants at St. Mallows in France; and the Kings proclamation to all his subjects.</title>
