      <title>A few words in brief for the worldly teachers and worshippers to consider of, who think that God heareth sinners; and though they alwayes erre in their hearts, that they shal be saved. For the awakening of such, I shall shew them, with the light, as it is noted in the Scriptures of truth, that God heareth not sinners; neither shall they that alwayes err in their hearts from God's wayes, enter into God's rest; the Lord hath sworn it: and this was finished from the foundation of the world. And also, what that light is in men, that every man is lighted withal, from the writing of prophets, philosophers, and modern teachers: and how men have pitched besides the Eben-ezer, or stone of help.</title>
