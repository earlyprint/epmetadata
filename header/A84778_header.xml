      <title>A declaration concerning fasting, and prayer. Of the true fast, which raiseth up the foundation of many generations; which is not the hanging down of the head like a bulrush for a day. Also; a declaration of the false fast, where is the hanging down the head like a bulrush for a day, and the bonds of iniquity standing, which iniquity seperates from God, while that is standing; the foundation of many generations is not seen. And sheweth, the prayer that God accepts, and what he hears, that which is from his Spirit, and sheweth what prayers he hears not, which is contrary to it, which God accepts not; and here you may see the difference between the true praying and the false.</title>
