Being his kind legacy, to his fellow creatures: or, the physician, and no physician, prescribing physick, and no physick; shewing plain, easie, and cheap ways, how every man may become his own physician, his own apothecary, and his own chyrurgeon, with little or no trouble, but far less cost. Whereby sickness may certainly be prevented to the well; health, as certainly procur'd to the sick; and man's life comfortably preserv'd, to a good old age.... Divided into 2 parts, by two universal medicines; the one physical, the other natural; the first the worst, the second the best. Also a short discourse concerning the phylosopher's stone, ... With several other choice observations of profitable use, as may be seen in the table here annext.</title>
