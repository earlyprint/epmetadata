      <title>The service that is performed in the Kings Free Chappel of S. George in the Castle of Windsor, upon Obiit Sunday in the morning (that is the Sunday before every quarter-day) and at the offering up of the atchievements of the deceased Knights of the Garter. The service is the same that is appointed in the Book of Common Prayer, until you come to the Psalms for the day of the moneth: in stead of which you have these proper Psalms : Psalm XXI, CXLVI, CXLVII.</title>
