      <title>Usury stated overthrown: or, usuries champions with their auxiliaries, shamefully disarmed and beaten by an answer to its chief champion, which lately apeared in print to defend it. And Godliness epitomized by Christopher Jelinger, M.A. Beza upon Matth. May a man with a safe conscience lend upon usury? No surely. And holy Usher, Arch-Bishop of Armagh, in his Body of divinity, pag. 300. Q. What is that which we call usury? It is lending in expectation of certain gain. So he well stateth it against usury ill stated by T. P. Q. What do you think of it? If we speak of that properly, which the scripture condemneth, it is a most wicked and unlawful contract; which if we live and die in, without repentance, we are excluded out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Psal. 15.1,5. Ezek. 18.12,13. and chap. 22. But there is much questioning, which is that usury which the scripture condemneth. Therefore it will be our wisdom wholly to forbear it, and not to put our souls, which are of more value than the whole world, upon nice discourses, and subtil distinctions. Thus this holy man.</title>
