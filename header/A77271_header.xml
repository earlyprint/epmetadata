      <title>The anatomy of et cætera. Or the unfolding of that dangerous oath in the close of the sixth canon. As it was contrived by the bishops and some of the clergie, in their late oath ex officio, cunningly obliging the consciences of his Majesties subjects to observe and obey whatsoever errours they would impose. Condemned and dissected in a passionate conference betwixt the two zealous brothers Roger and Ralph, penned at the first injunction of the new canons, and now publisht since their abolishment. / By an Oxfordshire gentleman.</title>
