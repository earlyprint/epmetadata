      <title>Englands remonstrance. Or, a word in the ear to the scattered, discontented members of the late Parliament. Shewing, that self-seekers are self-losers; and that no member ought to feather his own nest, but freely permit every bird to enjoy his own feathers, and every honest man to sit under his own vine, and enjoy the fruits thereof. Likewise, a word to the present assembly at Westminster, and the councel of state at White Hall, in order to their present power, rule, government; and the peoples rights, liberties, and priviledges.
