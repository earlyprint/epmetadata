      <title>A vindication of Psalme 105.15. (touch not mine anoynted, and doe my prophets no harme) from some false glosses lately obtruded on it by Royallists. Proving that this divine inhibition was given to kings, not subjects; to restraine them from injuring and oppressing Gods servants, and their subjects; who are Gods anoynted, as well as kings: and that it is more unlawfull for kings to plunder and make war upon their subjects, by way of offence, then for subjects to take up armes against kings in such cases by way of defence. With a briefe exhortation to peace and unity.</title>
