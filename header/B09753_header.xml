      <title>The musical shepeherdess, or, Dorinda's lamentation for the loss of Amintas Amintas all Arcadia's glory was, a youth so sweet that all he did surpass. But times all mowing sith this flower did cut, fate to his days hath the last period put : for musick and for singing, who but he, was fit to help the Gods with harmony? His fair Dorinda, seeing he was gone, and she poor mournful damsel left alone, invokes the nymphs to sing his praise, whilst she a garland weaves, then ends her days, resolving not to stay behind her love, she being deny'd him here, mounts above. To a pleasant new tune, called Amintas farewel, or, Digby's farewel.</title>
