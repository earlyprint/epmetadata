      <title>A Looking-glass for England being an abstract of the bloody massacre in Ireland, by the instigation of the Jesuites, priests and friars, who were chief promoters of those horrible murthers, prodigious cruelties, barbarous villanies, and inhumane practices, executed by the Irish papists upon the English Protestants in the year 1642 : as also a brief apology in the behalf of the Protestants in the valleys of Piedmont : with a narrative of the barbarous butcheries, inhumane cruelties, most exercrable and unheard-of villanies, perpetrated on them by the Popish party during the heat of the late massacre in April 1655.  Stirred up by the malice and instigation of the Devil acting in the popish clergie.</title>
