      <title>A small mite, in memory of the late deceased (yet still living, and never to be forgotten) Mr. William Erbery. Being 1. An acrostick on the letters of his name. 2. An elegie on his death, or worthy living fame. Whereunto are added two new songs: the one being some brief touches on the 12 chapter of the Revelation, more fully to be enlarged in the experimental Christian. The other, touching the doing away of sin through the Lord Christ in our souls, and the dostroying [sic] all our mental enemies: with other remarkable passages. Some are dead that seem alive: but Erbery's worth shall still survive.</title>
