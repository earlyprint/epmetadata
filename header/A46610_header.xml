          <note>"The attribution to James V of Scotland is almost certainly false; evidence for and against the authorship of James I of Scotland, now generally accepted, is summarized in David Irving's 'The history of Scotish poetry' (1861), p. 142-148"--NUC pre-1956 imprints.</note>
          <note>Imprint suggested by NUC pre-1956 imprints.</note>
          <note>Two ballads on one sheet; possibly intended to be cut and sold separately.</note>
          <note>The banishment of poverty is "a ballad describing the wanderins of an itinerant and the relief of his poverty by the Duke of Albany"--NUC pre-1956 imprints.</note>
          <note>The banishment of poverty identified variously as Wing D30A and B645A; Wing 2nd ed. described this as a post-1700 publication, cancelled D30A and provided no entry for B645A.</note>
          <note>Reproduction of original in the Harvard University Library.</note>
