      <title>Heare, heare, heare, heare, a vvord or message from heaven; to all Covenant breakers (whom God hates) with all that hath committed that great sinne, that is, as the sinne of witch-craft. The great God that is most high and infinite, that hath the command of heaven and earth, and of all therein; who hath taken to himselfe that liberty as not to give an account of any of his matters to any of his creatures; and this is the power of his excellency which he holdeth forth for all our learning in his word, and his liberty God hath given to kings on earth: and none may say to the King, what dost thou? And now that Gods commandements hath not been observed, but the power resisted, it is high time that they were.</title>
