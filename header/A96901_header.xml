      <title>Soft answers unto hard censures: relating, I. To a book printed without licence. A full accompt given thereof. II. To my particular calling: 3 offences relating thereunto removed: and the dutie of visiting families and schooles is pressed upon magistrates and ministers, whose duty it is to visite there, enquiring how the governours and governed, do answer their relations, the one commanding, the other obeying in the Lord. III. To the offence given by a book called an Anti-apologie, which I have said, is a great offence to the church of God; and that they, who write as Mr. Edwards does, too many by two, have offended their lord and master, more than Moses did, when he said, ye rebels, for which unadvised speaking (yet the people were little better) though he would, he could not compound with his lord God almighty. ... / By Hezekiah Woodward.</title>
