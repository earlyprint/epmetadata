      <title>Light risen out of darkness now in these latter days. Shewing the dark ways and worships of the ministry of Antichrist now in these apostated times, which is perilous, as is foretold of often by the Holy Ghost that spoke through Paul, and now is fulfilled in these latter days, 2 Tim 3. Thus saith the Lord, Arise Sion, and thresh with a sharp threshing instrument, and shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen, and is arising, and Jerusalem shall be a burdensome stone to all nations, now that Christ is unto his people both the light and glory thereof. Wherein something is written in reply to a book that was set forth by the dry and night vines in and about Beverley, who scornfully nicknameth the people of God, in reviling and falsly accusing them, and calleth them Quakers, in and about York-shire. Iuly, 1653.</title>
