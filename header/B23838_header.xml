      <title>The antelope's evidence; or, An experimental and ocular demonstration of the goodness and excellency of mill'd-lead-sheathing, above that of wood. Wherein is also prov'd, that it is much cheaper at 14d. a foot, the rate publish'd, than wood-sheathing, if it were reckon'd but at 7d. a foot. The lead being consider'd only to last no longer than an ordinary wood-sheathing, tho' 'tis evident it would outlast many of the best that were ever put on.</title>
