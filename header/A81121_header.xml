      <title>Lawles tythe-robbers discovered: who make tythe-revenue a mock-mayntenance, being encouraged thereunto by the defect of law and justice about ministers maintenance; and by the cavills and pretended objections against it. Which defect of law and justice is herein fully discovered, together with the frauds and wrongs occasioned by that defect, that they may be prevented by better laws, and more impartiall justice, now in Parliament-time, wherein remedies have always been most speedy and certain. Herein the many cavills and pretended objections made against tythes, and all setled maintenance of ministers are recited and confuted. Herein also, some motives to the higher powers for speedy relief of ministers, by better laws. Together with some humble proposals of means for the rooting out and preventing of those frauds and wrongs. Imprimature, Edm. Calamy.</title>
