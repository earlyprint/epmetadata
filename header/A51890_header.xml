          <note>The first edition of this work began publication in 1684 when a volume in Italian entitled "L'esploratore Turco" and a French version entitled "L'esplou du grand seigneur" were published in Paris by C. Barbin. Authorship is disputed, but it is generally agreed that the first fifty letters (the original four volumes) were written by Marana. In the English editions, v. 1 contains the substance of the letters commonly ascribed to Marana. The continuation (i.e. v. 2-8), said to have appeared first in English, has been variously ascribed to Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw; Bradshaw has also been attributed as the translator (from Marana's Italian manuscripts) of the entire work under Dr. Midgley's editorship. cf. DNB; also Gentleman's magazine, 1841, p. 270.</note>
