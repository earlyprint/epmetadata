      <title>We have brought our hogs to a fair market: or, Strange newes from New-Gate; being a most pleasant and historical narrative, of Captain James Hind, never before published, of his merry pranks, witty jests, unparallel'd attempts, and strange designs. With his orders, instructions, and decree, to all his royal gang, and fraternity; the appearing of a strange vision on Munday morning last, with a crown upon his head; the speech and command that were then given to Cap. Hind; and the manner how it vanished away. As also how he was enchanted by a witch at Hatfield, for the space of three years; and how she switch'd his horse with a white rod, and gave him a thing like a sun-diall, the point of which should direct him which way to take when persued. With his speech; the old hags charm; and the raising of the Devil in the likeness of a lyon; to the great admiration and wonder of all that shall read the same.</title>
