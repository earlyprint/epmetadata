      <title>A declaration against the Antinomians, and their doctrine of liberty. Their chief tenents briefly and fully answered; and the danger of those erronoeus points manifested: with a caution to such as are or have been so misled, to persvvade with them to turn from that evill into which they are or have been seduced. These being their conclusions, understood by most auditors. I. That God doth never inflict punishment upon the elect for their sins. II. That God is never angry with his children. III. That God sees no sin in those that are his. IV. That such as are elected, are at all times beloved of God; in what condition soever they be, be they never so great sinners, yea, in the very act of sinne it selfe. V. That sanctification of life in duties of piety, is nothing at all esteemed of God. VI. That the godly finde no difficulties in the way to Heaven, but live in much pleasure and delight in this world. VII. That those who belong to God, are able in this world presently to distinguish betwixt Gods people and the wicked.</title>
