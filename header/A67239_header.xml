      <title>A prospective glasse wherein Englands bondage under the Normane yoke, with the rise, growth, and continuation is clearly asserted, a subject not yet treated upon ... shewing how the law came to be in an unknown tongue, and from whence the judges and other inferior lawyers had their beginning, and in opposition to former law, how the 4 termes of the yeer came to be kept : as also, the corruption of this law, bringing with it the fines and rents to the lord of the manor for all free- holds and copyhold land : being a collection from the most choice of modern historians : with some copyhold land : being a collection from the most choice of modern historians : with some brief observations upon Scripture, as proving from thence that this law is contradictory to the nature of God's dealing with the sons of man, and contrary to the nature of freedome / by a lover of Englishmens freedomes.</title>
