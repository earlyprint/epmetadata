      <title>The Kentish wonder: being a true relation how a poor distressed widow, in the wild of Kent, was by the providence of the Almighty, miraculously preserved in her necessity, so that she and seven small children lived seven weeks upon a burnt six-penny loaf of bread, and yet it never decreased; to the great wonder of all that hear it, and the praise of the Almighty, who never forsakes them who put their trust in him.
