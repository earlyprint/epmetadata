      <title>The cavaliers jubilee: or, long look'd for come at last: viz. the generall pardon. In a pleasant dialogue between Sir Timothy Turn-coat, and Sir Rowland Resolute, two cavaliers that met accidentally, and were lately come over from beyond sea, upon the noise of the generall pardon, and their resolution to leave the service of the young Charles Stuart, and imbrace the Parliaments protection in their gracious act of oblivion. Together with the condolement of the late made lords and knights for the losse of their honors which they received from the late King and his son, for the rebellion against the Parliament, and acting against their country, by that late just Act of Parliament for the disanulment of them.</title>
