      <title>A true relation of Mr. Iohn Cook's passage by sea from Wexford to Kinsale in that great storm Ianuary 5. Wherein is related the strangeness of the storm, and the frame of his spirit in it. Also the vision that he saw in his sleep, and how it was revealed that he should be preserved, which came to pass very miraculously. Likewise a relation of a dream of a Protestant lady in Poland, which is in part come to pass, the remainder being to begin this year 1650. / All written by himself.</title>
