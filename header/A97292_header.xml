      <title>The duckers duck'd, and duck'd, and duck'd again, head, and ears, and all over; for plunging, scolding, and defaming Occasioned by a message brought me by an Anabaptist. Thus if you stop not the press, four men will swear sodomy against you. Humbly offered to the consideration of learned, pious Anabaptists; who confess I have given their cause of plunging a dreadful blow. With friendly address to Mr. Philosensus, whose mistake in thus joyning this Greek and Latin word together, helps me to a thought against plunging. That it not only tends to, but actually doth deprive some men, but especially women, (on their own confession) of their senses when baptized, (as they call it) and therefore is not, cannot be an ordinance of Christ, but a human, or rather diabolical invention. With more arguments against plunging. By Trepidantium Malleus.</title>
