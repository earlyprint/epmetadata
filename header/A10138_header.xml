          <note>The discourse of wedlock is erroneously attributed to John Rogers. It is actually a revised excerpt of "A viewe of mans estate" by Andrew Kingsmill (STC 15003). "The glasse of godly loue", a reprint of Hermann von Wied's "A brefe and a playne declaratyon of the dewty of maried folkes" (STC 13208), has separate divisional title.</note>
