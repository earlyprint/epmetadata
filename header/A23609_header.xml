      <title>A confession of faith, of the severall congregations or churches of Christ in London, which are commonly (though unjustly) called Anabaptists Published for the vindication of the truth, and information of the ignorant; likewise for the taking off of those aspersions which are frequently, both in pulpit and print, unjustly cast upon them. Unto which is added, Heart-bleedings for professors abominations: or, A faithfull generall epistle (from the same churches) presented to all who have known the way of truth, fore-warning them to flee security, and carelesse walking under the profession of the same, discovering some of Satans wiles, whereby also wanton persons and their ungodly wayes are disclaimed.</title>
