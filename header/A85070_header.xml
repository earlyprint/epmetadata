      <title>The faithful lovers downfal: or, The death of fair Phillis who killed her self for loss of her Philander Phillis for loss of her Philander, through each grove doth wander; until she hears by fate he's slain, which causes her so to complain: o're-whelm'd in tears, she does conclude, to end her life, which soon ensu'd; for with her fatal dagger, she stab'd to the heart, sets sorrow free; dying with patience, braving fate, that to her love did her translate. To a pleasant new play-house tune: or, Oh! cruel bloody fate.</title>
