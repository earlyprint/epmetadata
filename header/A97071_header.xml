Also true information from the ships which ride before Galway, wherein is manifested a true relation how certain ships from Spaine laden with ammunition, made an attempt to land, but were pursued by the said ships, and forced to strike into a small creek, where they stuck fast, and were taken by the English.

With a true information that many of the Irish commanders have left their service in Ireland, and are come for England: namely, the Lord Grendison, Captain Bartlet, and Captain Gibson, with many others: also how the officers now resident in Ireland have all this summer been backward to oppose the rebels, pretending that they are commanded so to do.
