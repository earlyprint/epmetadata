      <title>The first search: after one grand cause of the wrath of God yet against his people, in the use of the so much idolized liturgie, or common prayer. With two and twenty reasons from the word of God, and the late covenant, for the present disuse of it. And proving it, as it is now idolized, to be full against the lawes of this kingdome. Published by authority.</title>
