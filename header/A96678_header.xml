      <title>The yovng-mans second vvarning-peece, or, A miracle of mercies being a true relation of the horrible suggestions and tentations, wherwith Satan assaulted me A. W. stationer of London : wherby he prevailed so far, as to force me to sin grosly, and to despaire fearfully, in so much that he brought me near unto the making of my selfe away, many and sundry ways, from the which the Lord in mercy delivered me : and therefore as a testimony of my thankfullnesse to God, and love to my brethren and former sinfull associats, I have thought good to publish in print, both the manner and time of my conflict and also of my delivery.</title>
