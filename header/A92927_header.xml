To abstain from every appearance of evil; much more from every apparent evil. 2 Thes. 5. 22. 4. Do violence, or wrong, to no man; neither accuse any man falsly. Luke 3.14. Now, how Sir Tho. Fairfax's army of saints and Christian soldiers have performed all these, or any of these, shal be faithfully and plainly declared, in 20. following observations. / By a loyal lover of peace and truth; but a hearty contemner of sedition and schism.</title>
