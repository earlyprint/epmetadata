      <title>The credulous virgins complaint. Or, Lovers made happy at last. Being a caution to the female sex. Being a most pleasant new song in two parts, with the youngmans [sic] kind answer. Celia complains virgins are oft too kind, the which she did by late experience find, for yielding unto Damon she does prove that hasty pleasures are the bain of love; but in the tempest of her wounding grief, Damon comes in and yields her kind relief: but vows renew, and at last both are wed, though he before had got her maiden-head. To the tune of Sawny will never be my love again.</title>
