      <title>To all you taylors and brokers, who lyes [sic] in wickedness and to all you tradesmen of what trade, imployment or office soever. This to all you from the Lord, that you may return from all your evil wayes, words and works; that you may be hid in the day of his fierce wrath. Knowing also assuredly, that all your prayers, tears and sacrifices are not available, while you regard iniquity in your hearts; your meeting together, and best performances are but sin, and an ill savour in the nostrils of the Lord: therefore from them all return and repent, and leave off your sins; that you may find rest for your souls.</title>
