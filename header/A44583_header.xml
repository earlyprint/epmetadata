          <note>"The character of a trimmer" is given first on the film and has a t.p. which reads: The character of a trimmer ... The third edition. The Advice to a daughter follows The character of a trimmer and has a t.p. which follows the general t.p., and reads: The lady's New-Year's gift, or, Advice to a daughter ... The sixth edition, exactly corrected.</note>
          <note>The first three editions of The character of a trimmer were erroneously ascribed to Sir William Coventry: now established as the work of his nephew, George Savile, Marquis of Halifax. Cf. DNB.</note>
