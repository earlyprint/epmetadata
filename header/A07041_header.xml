          <note>Martin Senior = Martin Marprelate, who has been identified with John Penry and, more probably, with Job Throckmorton.</note>
          <note>Often referred to as "Martin Senior".</note>
          <note>On the two title pages seen (Huntington and Lambeth) the space after "Mar-prelate" in line 9 of the title has slipped under the forme; the letters "prelate" are very heavily printed and some of the surrounding type has failed to print.</note>
          <note>Imprint from STC.</note>
          <note>Signatures: A-D‚Å¥.</note>
          <note>Running title reads: The reproofe of Martin Iunior.</note>
