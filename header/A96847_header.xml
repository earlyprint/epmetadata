      <title>The wonderful deliverance at sea or, The miraculous preservation of several persons belonging to the ship called William and Dorothy lately cast away in a voyage to New-Castle. Who by a most gracious providence were kept alive for the space of twelve days and nights without any food, in a small boat, on the main sea: in all which time, onely one child perished, being starved to death with cold and hunger, and the rest were at last taken up, and carried into Holland on the 28th. of November last. And several of them are now safely arrived in England. With allowance, Roger L'Estrange.</title>
