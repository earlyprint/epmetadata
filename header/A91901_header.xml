      <title>The petitioners vindication from calumnie and aspersion. And the young mans animation to the building up of Zion. Published in their defence, against a scurrilous book or pamphlet lately written against them by I.W. and scandalously intituled, Petitions against bishops and their votes in Parliament. Subscribed unto after a clandestine, delivered after a tumultuous manner, and falsly going under the name of a whole county or town, proved to be both contrary to our late taken Protestation, as also utterly unlawfull by many other cleare and evident reasons. Now answered and refuted, and petitions delivered unto the Parliament, by impregnable reasons proved to be both lawfull, and according to the petitioners duty, and the late taken Protestation. With many other remarkable passages worthy of observation. By T. Robinson, veritati devotum.</title>
