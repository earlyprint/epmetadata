      <title>A second edition of the nevv almanack for the year 1656. Or, the nocturnall revised: being annotations upon the late Mercurius Aëro-machus. Wherein that author, or the printer for him, which is all one was very rightly mistaken, when he intituled the same a rel--i--ation of strange and wonderful sights seen in the aire on the first of January last, at the time the moon was in the eclipse. The truth whereof, if any man doubteth, it is but airing his horse in a morning or so, as far as Selby in Yorkshire, which is scarce an 150 miles off, where the print of the horses feet are still to be seen in the skie. Together with an huge compasse-window rainbow, seen that night at Jack-daw-ood, in the same countie; where the eccho of the drums and trumpets remian visibly to be heard to this day. Being likewise communicated in a letter to a friend, with an epistle dedicatory at the end of the book.</title>
