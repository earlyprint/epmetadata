          <note>A partial reprinting and defense of his "Sermon of reformation" and a partial reprinting of and reply to John Saltmarsh's "Examinations", including a reprinting of the preface to that work on leaf A2.</note>
          <note>The imprint is a counterfeit (Madan).</note>
          <note>A reissue with cancel title page of the edition with London in imprint (Wing F2475). However, this reissue lacks the full reprinting of Fuller's "A sermon of reformation" ([2], 5-24 p.; A⁴-C⁴(-A1)) found in Wing F2475. Statements made by the author in "To my deare parish Saint Mary Savoy" (C1r) and "To the reader" (C4r) in the preliminaries indicate that the sermon was intended to be included as part of this work, and it may be that copies without the sermon are simply imperfect reissues. The sermon was also apparently issued separately in the same year.</note>
          <note>Annotation on Thomason copy reads: "March 8".</note>
