      <title>Sighs for Sion: or, Faith and love constraning some grievings in her sorrow, and groanings for her deliverance: by a few of her weak and unworthy children. Humbly, and in all faithfulness, presented to those assemblies of hers, where grace hath set them as watchmen; and unto any others, that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours. In way of essay, to blow the trumpet in Sion, and sound an alarm in Gods holy mountain, to the awakening them that are at ease, and pressing and encouraging all the upright in heart, to be in pain with her, in this day of her sore travel, and great expectation.</title>
