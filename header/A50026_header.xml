      <title>Sionis reductio, &amp; exultatio. Or, Sions return out of captivity with Sions reioycing for her return. A discourse, intended for the solemn festivity of the English nation, at Livorno in Italy, upon the happy news of King Charles the Second his return into England, which was there celebrated with munificent feasting, and magnificent shows, fire-works, and other signs of triumph, three days together, in the month of July anno Dom. 1660. Since occasionally preached in part, at St. Margarets in Westminster, the Sonday [sic] after the solemnization of the Kings birth-day, and entry into London; and now presented to publick view, as to correct the mis-apprehension, and mis-interpretation of some that were present; so to prevent the mis-information, and depravation of others that were absent. By Ro. le Grosse, cleric. An orthodox priest of the Church of England; and D. Oecumenical, then residing in Livorno, at his return from grand Cairo in Egypt.</title>
