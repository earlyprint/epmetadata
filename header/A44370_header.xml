          <note>Attributed by Wing to Edward Hales, eldest son of Sir Edward Hales, who was killed at the Battle of the Boyne. However, as it is unusual for the heir to a title to attend university, it is equally likely that the speech was that of his younger brother John, who became the third Baronet.</note>
