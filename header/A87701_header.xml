      <title>A free, plain, and just way concerning communion and excommunication, at, or from the Lords table. With a Christian account concerning the same. With answers to the objections to the contrary. In which is shewed, that the Church to day hath no more power to excommunicate from the Lords table, then it had yesterday power to separate from the altar, unto which sinners were exhorted by the church to go; whereby they might (as they are required at the Lords table) perfect their praises and repentance. And that the pretended differences in baptism, are no just ground of separation. / Written by William Kaye, with Christians approbation, with submission to the general oversight.</title>
