      <title>A letter from a stranger to a minister, clearly shewing by the unerring light of nature and scripture, not only what sin is and has done to angels and men, and why the one cannot, and how and by whom the other is delivered therefrom, and what is expected from 'em thereupon, and what return has been made for the same: but how antichristianism, by the brightness of our Lords coming, seems to be dwindling into nothing; mauger all opposition, of cunning selfish men. And that the great revolution (so much in expectation, and so assured to us by divine revelation) is near approaching; and what preceeds it, and will attend it, and how all are concern'd in it; and what they, but the clergy especially, are to do in order thereunto, to qualify and fit themselves for it. The secrets of the Lord are with them that fear him.</title>
