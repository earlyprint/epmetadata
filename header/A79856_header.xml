      <title>A two-fold shaking of the earth: or, an exposition on Heb. 12.26, 27 Wherein is shewed, the first shaking of the earth, seems to be meant the putting down of the late King and bishops: the later shaking, a change of the present government. And reasons given for both. Also how, and in what manner this later earth-shaking may be according to scripture-prophesie: namely, by that earth-quake, Rev. 11.13 which is likewise opened. Lastly, here are many reasons given, why it may be hoped that this present parliament will prove to be that earth-quake (or at least begin the work) whereby the good old cause will be revived, the just rights of the people restored, and the nation setled upon a lasting and durable foundation of truth and righteousness. By John Canne.</title>
