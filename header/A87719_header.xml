      <title>Ancient and durable gospel. Concerning the time of the perfect and totall subduing, washing away, remitting, blotting out, and pardoning, believers sins : and believers being justified, adopted, married to Christ; and presented by Christ spotlesse. Shewing, that though these things were in purpose before the world was, in prophesie, and promise, before Christ dyed; purchased just then; and applyed by faith when we believe. Yet the said purpose is not executed; the said prophesies are not accomplisht; nor promises fulfilled; the things purchased are not effected, nor by us fully enjoyed, till Christs second comming : at which time the saints that sleep shall arise : and scattered Israel shall be gathered. / Written by Thomas Kilcop. In two books; the one iu [sic] an orderly sermon-method : the other by way of answer to a book intituled. Justification by Christ alone : a good title, were the book but sutable.</title>
