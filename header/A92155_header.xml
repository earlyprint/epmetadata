          <note>In 4 parts. Parts 1 and 2, by Bruno Ryves, were originally issued at Oxford as 21 separate newsbooks between 20 May 1643 and 16 March 1644. Part 2, "Mercurius rusticus: or, The countries complaint, of the sacriledges, prophanations, and plundrings, committed by the schismatiques, on the cathedrall churches of this kingdome" has separate title page with imprint "Oxford, printed in the yeare, 1646"; pagination and register are continuouswith part 1. Parts 3 and 4, "Querela Cantabrigiensis" and "Micro-chronicon" each have separate dated title page, pagination, and register. The former is attributed to John Barwick, and the latter to Bruno Ryves. "Querela Cantabrigiensis" was also probably issued separately (Wing B1010), as was "Micro-chronicon" (Wing R2451).</note>
          <note>This issue, the earlier, lacks an 8-page addition signed a which cancels leaf A8. This earlier issue is identified by Madan as 1890b*, one of the issues that constitute the second collected edition of those printed other than at Oxford.</note>
