      <title>The Lords loud call to England: being a true relation of some late, various, and wonderful judgments, or handy-works of God, by earthquake, lightening, whirlewind, great multitudes of toads and flyes; and also the striking of divers persons with sudden death, in several places; for what causes let the man of wisdome judge, upon his serious perusal of the book it self. Also of the strange changes, and late alterations made in these three nations. As also of the odious sin of drinking healths, with a brief of Mr. Pryns solid arguments against it, and his epistle to the late King Charls, to redress it. Published by H.J. a servant of Jesus the Christ, and lover of peace and holiness.</title>
