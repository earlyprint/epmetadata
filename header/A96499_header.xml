      <title>A letter sent from [brace] Mr. Sergeant Wilde, and Humphrey Salwey, [brace] Esq; both members of the House of Commons, to the Honorable, William Lentall Esquior, Speaker of the House of Commons; concerning divers passages at the quarter sessions in Worcester, about the execution of the commission of array, and the ordinance of the militia: at which sessions was the greatest assembly that hath been seen for many yeers past. Together with the humble petition of the grand-jury-men of that sessions to the knights, and justices of that county; wherein it appears they are well satisfied of the illegality of the commission of array; with their desires of the speedy execution of the militia, by them who are intrusted therewith. Read in the House of Commons, and ordered by them to be forthwith printed and published. H. Elsynge, Cler. Parl. D. Com.</title>
