      <title>A brief review of the most material Parliamentary proceedings of this present Parliament, and their armies, in their civil and martial affairs. Which Parliament began the third of November, 1640. And the remarkable transactions are continued untill the Act of Oblivion, February 24. 1652. Published as a breviary, leading all along successiviely, as they fell out in their severall years: so that if any man will be informed of any remarkable passage, he may turne to the year, and so see in some measure, in what moneth thereof it was accomplished. And for information of such as are altogether ignorant of the rise and progresse of these times, which things are brought to passe, that former ages have not heard of, and after ages will admire. A work worthy to be kept in record, and communicated to posterity.</title>
