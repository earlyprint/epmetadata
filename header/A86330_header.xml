      <title>A discourse of the souls of men, women, and children; and of the holy and blessed angels in heaven, and of the evil and damned spirits in hell: shewing that they are immortal, spiritual substances, as well as the angels in heaven. Written because this author met with four willfull ignorant men at one time, which said, the souls of men, women, and children, were nothing but breath, and vanished into air, when as the body went to the grave. These unfaithful people ought to be answered and reproved: / by the author, Thomas Hicks.</title>
