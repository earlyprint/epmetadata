          <note>Wing identifies the author as John Philipot, 1589?-1645, but this attribution is unlikely. Philipot was 1) Somerset Herald 1624 and 2) D.C.L. Oxford 1643.  He would not have referred to himself (or have been referred to posthumously) as Master in Arts. Further, as a royalist active on the side of the King, Philipot is unlikely to have had the gaming habits of the "youngmen and apprentices" of London uppermost in his mind. Foster and Venn list no John Philpot or Philipot (or variant) whose highest degree was Master of Arts and who was living in 1646 or shortly before.</note>
