      <title>A few vvords concerning conscience what it is; and what estate it was in before transgression. And how it became darkened, defiled and corrupted; and how again it may be enlightened, cleansed, purified and set at liberty, as it was before sin entred. Intermixt with a few words concerning persecution among the diverse sects in Christendom (and upon the face of all the earth); shewing, that they all arise for want of true liberty of conscience; and what that liberty is. William Shewen.</title>
