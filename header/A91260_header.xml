Dom. 1575, page 54, 57, 58, und this title, Prayers used in the churches of Scotland in the time of their persecution by the Frenchmen (in the year 1560) from whose tyranny and vassalage, they were then delivered by the Free Brotherly Assistance and forces of the English, to whom they had been formerly persidious.
