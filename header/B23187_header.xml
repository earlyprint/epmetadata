      <title>[The] words of the everlasting and true Light, vvho is the eternal living God, and the King of saints, which he gave unto me his servant, to declare unto the inhabitants of the earth, and unto all such as have any true tender desires in them after righteousnesse, and truth. And this is the message which I have heard and received of God, and now in his power do I declare it unto you, that the true God is Light, and in him is no darknesse at all, and he onely hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light, and all the nations of them that are saved shall walk in his light; but unto the wilful and disobedient who are offended at the light, the light shall be a rock of offence, and a stone of stumbling, and a snare, a trap, and a ginn, and they shall be snared, and shall stumble and fall and be broken by it. / By George Fox the younger in the truth.</title>
