          <edition>The second edition much enlarged and amended, and two new sheets of the prices and virtues of drugs added to the table of drugs, that was not in the former impression, with a caution to the farrier about his buying of them; also one hundred and fifty new receipts, and thirty directions for the physicking of horses, with about two thousand new simples, and an advertisement touching their usefulness; with many other new additions, too tedious here to rehearse.</edition>
