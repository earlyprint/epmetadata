      <title>A caution against sacriledge: or Sundry queries concerning tithes. Wherein is held forth the propriety, and title that ministers have to them, the mischiefs which would ensue if tithes were brought into a common treasury, and ministers reduced to stipends. The danger of gratifying the petitioners against tithes, and all imposed maintenance. And something of the spirit and end of their actings. Collected, and composed by the one that hath no propriety in tithes, and humbly tendred to this present Parliament.</title>
