      <title>Severall letters of complaint from the northern parts of this kingdom. Setting forth the barbarous cruelty and inhumanity of the Scotch Army, in destroying whole families, and towns, and carrying away all manner of portable goods, and driving away all forts of cattle into the kingdome of Scotland. Also their murthering of women in child-bed and robbing parents of thier deer children, more barbarously then the Irish rebels. To which is added a declaration of the county of Yorke thereupon, concerning their rising, (from the age of 16 to 60) as one man, to supresse these treacherous invadors, and secure themselves from utter ruin.</title>
