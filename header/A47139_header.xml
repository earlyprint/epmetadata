      <title>An essay for the discovery of some new geometrical problems (judged by some learned men, impracticable) concerning angular sections, beginning with the geometrical trisection of any right lined angle, by plain geometry of right lines and arches of circles, with rule and compass only, with out all conick sections, and cubick æquations. Whether the following praxis, and apparent demonstration thereof doth not only make it practicable, but easie to the understanding of a tiro, who but understands a little in true geometrical learning. Which layeth a foundation of a plain method how to sect any angle into any other number of parts required, even as 4. 6. 8. 10; or uneven, as 5. 7. 9. 11. &amp;c. As also to divide a circle into any number even, or uneven of equal parts. All which have great uses in the improvement of the mathematical sciences, some of which are here specified. Proposed and submitted to the impartial tryal and examination of the right reason of such artises, to whose hands it may come. By G.K.</title>
