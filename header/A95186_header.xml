      <title>August 3: A true relation of such passages and proceedings of the army of Dublin, in the Kingdome of Ireland as hath happened from the seventh of July to this present. Shewing how unprovided the rebels are of powder, and if now there be not a speedy supply of men and moneys, to destroy these rebels, how the Protestants are like to suffer through the kingdome this winter, by reason of supplies of armes as are providing and expected from Rome and Spaine. Published to prevent false and erronious copies, which too often are set forth with mighty disadvantage to the truth itself.</title>
