      <title>Chaos: or, A discourse wherein is presented to the view of the magistrate, and all others who shall peruse the same, a frame of government by way of a republique, wherein is little or no danger of miscarriage, if prudently attempted, and thoroughly prosecuted by authority. Wherein is no difficulty in the practice, nor obscurity in the method; but all things plain and easie to the meanest capacity. Here's no hard or strange names, nor unknown titles (to amaze the hearers) used, and yet here's a full and absolute power derivative insensibly from the whole, and yet practically conveyed to the best men: wherein if any shall endeavour a breach, he shall break himself: and it must be so, that cats shall provide supper, here they shall do it suitable to the best palats, and easie to digest. By a well-willer to the publique weale.</title>
