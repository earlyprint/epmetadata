      <title>A discovery of faith; wherein is laid down the ground of true faith, which sanctifieth and purifieth the heart, and worketh out the carnal part. Shewing the way that leadeth to salvation: with the difference betwixt the two seeds, the one of Mount Sinai, which tendeth to bondage; and the other, which is the immortal seed of God, begotten by the immortal word, which liveth and abideth for ever. Being as Isaac was, the childe of the promise, and of Jerusalem which is from above ... The difference betwixt the living word and the letter.</title>
