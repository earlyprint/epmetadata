      <title>A learned, pious, and practical commentary, upon the Gospel according to St. Mark wherein the sacred text is logically analyzed; the meaning of the holy Spirit clearly and soundly opened: doctrines naturally raised, strongly confirmed, vindicated from exceptions, and excellent inferences deduced from them: all seeming differences in the history between this and the other evangelists fairly reconciled: many important cases of conscience, judiciously, succinctly, and perspicuously solved. By that laborious and faithful servant of Christ, Mr. George Petter, late Minister of the Gospel at Bread in Sussex.</title>
