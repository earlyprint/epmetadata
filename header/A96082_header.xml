      <title>Swearing denyed in the New Covenant and its pretended foundation rased. VVith the remnant of lies swept away. And the great and glorious name of Jesus highly exalted, above every name, to which powerful name, all swearers, and false swearers, and lyars, fighters, plotters, and persecutors, who are in the strife against the Son of God, must bow and submit, or be broken in pieces, for his wrath is kindled and his glittering sword is whet, to take vengeance of all those that will not have him to reign over them, in truth and righteousnesse, to the glory of God the Father.
