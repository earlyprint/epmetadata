      <title>New Rome arraigned And out of her own mouth condemned. Containing a farther discovery of the dangerous errors, and pernicious principles of the leaders and teachers of the Foxonian Quakers: which tend to overthrow the Christian faith, to obstruct the Jews conversion, to encourage Mahumetism, and to pervert the right way of the Lord; which whether so or no, deserves the examination and consideration of the Christian ministry of all Protestant Churches, as they tender God's glory, and the good of souls. To which is added, Ten articles of the Christian faith, wrote by Geo. Keith, who was persecuted by the Quakers in Pensilvania for his Christian testimony. The second edition, with some alteration and additions, by Francis Bugg. Licensed, June 18th. 1694.</title>
