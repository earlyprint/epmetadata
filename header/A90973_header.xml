      <title>A parallel between the Israelites desiring of King Saul, and England's desiring of a Parliament. Or, A vindication of the eight chapter of the first book of Samuel, Ver. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wherefore all the elders of Israel gathered them together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, and said unto him, behold thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways, make us now a King to judge us like all other nations: but the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, give us a King to judge us, &amp;c. Wherein the text, 2 Sam. 21.1. is laregely cleared, where it is said: then there was a famine in the dayes of David three years together, and David asked counsell of the Lord: and the Lord answered, it is for Saul and for his bloudy house, because he slew the Gibeonites. With the manner how God is said to make Saul King over Israel in wrath.</title>
