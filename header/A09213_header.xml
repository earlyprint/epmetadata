          <note>The book exists in three states of the preliminaries and final leaves; contents are given here in presumed chronological order from F.S. Ferguson's notes. State 1: collates *⁴ B-G⁴ H²  (-H1 or 2), with commendatory verses on *4 only. State 2: collates *⁴ [sec.]²  B-G⁴ H²  (-H1 or 2); quire [sec.] contains additional verses. State 3 (pagination given above): collates *⁴ [sec.]⁴ B-G⁴ H²  (-H1 or 2) I²  [K]² . Quire [sec.] contains additional verses, some printed from the standing type of state 2 quire [sec.]. Leaves I1-[K]1 contain "The contentes of the articles of assurance"; [K]2, a table of contents, is often usually bound in or after quire *.</note>
          <note>In all states *2 is missigned "*.i.". The two leaves of H²  were printed with the same text set in duplicate, intended to be divided and one leaf or the other to be bound into each copy. One setting is signed "H.", the other "H.i.".</note>
          <note>Quire I comes in two states: I1r line 1 of text has (1) "aduentured with" or (2) "aduentured in money".</note>
