      <title>The dovvnfall of the pretended divine authoritie of the hierarchy into the Sea of Rome. From some arguments, and motives, to the finall extirpation of that unlawfull government of the prelacy: as having no foundation in the Scriptures, but onely in that filthy dung-hill of the canon law of the Popes authoritie, and therefore antichristian. And so they are wrongfully blamed for abuse of their offices, the very nature and right use whereof is to overthrow churches and kingdoms, laws of God &amp; man, to propagate the kingdom of Antichrist: the office is so bad as cannot be used otherwise. Also their dangerous practises discovered: and the great objection of martyr-prelates answered. by V.N.V.</title>
