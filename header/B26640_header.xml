      <title>A match at a venture: or, time [and] opportunity won the day. Being, a discourse of wooing between two lovers. The young-man courted her with complements most rare, and all his mind to her he boldly did declare; she still held off, aud [sic] was so stiff inclin'd, and would not quickly let him know her mind: until that cupid with his golden dart had made a wound, and pierc'd her tender heart: and then she yielded his true love to be, they now are married, and live most gallantly. Tune of, Jenny come tye my bonny cravat.</title>
