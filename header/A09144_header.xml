          <note>Dedication signed: Crispian de passe Iunior.</note>
          <note>A translation by Thomas Wood or E.W. of: Hortus floridus.</note>
          <note>"The booke to his readers" is signed by Thomas Wood; the translator's dedication to book four is signed: E.W.</note>
          <note>In two parts, the first containing four books according to the seasons. Part 2, "Altera pars horti floridi" has divisional title and an engraved Biblical text ([2] leaves) followed by 62 leaves of plates with letterpress Latin descriptions on facing pages.</note>
          <note>Several plates in part 1, books 1 and 2 are signed by Simon van de Pass and Willem van de Passe.</note>
          <note>First part letterpress signatures: A-GÂ² , all in English. These leaves were evidently intended to be dispersed through part 1, quires A-C having the general preliminaries and the text for book 1 (spring), quire D having the text for book 2 (summer), E1-F1 for book 3 (autumn), and F2-G2 for book 4 (winter). Some copies may have additional letterpress leaves with text in other languages.</note>
          <note>Copies vary in the number of plates in part 1, and plates may have letterpress Latin text on versos. For book 1 originally 41 flower plates (some unnumbered) and one "garden" plate were engraved (the latter with legend "Meridies" at top but other directions not labeled); later 12 plates numbered 43-54 were added. Book 2 originally had 19 plates; later a plate 20 was added, and another copy of the "garden" plate may be present. Book 3 has 26 numbered plates (two numbered 25) plus a "garden" plate with "Meridies" at top and the other three directions also labeled; book 4 has 12 numbered plates and possibly a duplicate of the second "garden" plate.</note>
