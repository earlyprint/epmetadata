      <title>A Leicester-shire frolick; or, The valiant cook-maid Being a merry composed jest of five taylors that had been at work till their wages came to 5 pounds; likewise a merry conceited cook-maid that lived in the house, went to her master and desired him to lend her a horse, and she would venture her skill to take the 5-pound from these five taylors, without either sword or pistol, in a jesting way, to make her master some sport and to show her valour: her master loving mirth more then sadness, agreed to it: so a horse was sadled, and other things to disguise her self, because she might not be known: away she went (it being in the evening) and met them before they got home, with nothing in her hand but a black pudding, the faint-hearted taylors delivered her their money very quietly, for fear they should a been shot through with a black pudding, and what followed after is expressed in this following ditty. Tune is, Ragged and torn. With allowance.</title>
