          <note>"In 1658 a controversy about presbyterian church government arose between the Rev. Isaac Allen of Prestwich and other episcopalians and the Manchester Classis, and Harrison was deputed by that presbytery to write in their defence." This is the resulting volume of papers written on both sides. -- DNB.</note>
