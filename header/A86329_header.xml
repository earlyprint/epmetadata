      <title>The order of causes. Of [brace] Gods fore-knowledge, election, and predestination. And of mans salvation or damnation. Laid down so clearly, and proved so plainly by the scriptures, that even the meanest capacity amongst rational men may understand it, to their great satisfaction. As also, whether Christ died for all, or not for all: with the causes and effects that may follow or not follow, seriously considered, meekly controverted, and plainly proved by the scriptures of truth; to the great satisfaction of all rational people fearing God. By Henry Haggar, a servant of Christ, and of the congregations of his saints.</title>
