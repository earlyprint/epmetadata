      <title>The poor man's mite, unto the more large contributions of the liberal, at this day freely added, in testimony of that respect which is born unto the faithful and their interest, as it's laid up and hid in Jesus. Briefly discovering, 1. The vanity of that rejoycing, which seems to glory in any thing save the Lord. 2. What is required of all that expect to have the form of the Lords house revealed unto them. 3. That however the chief corner-stone may be rejected, none other foundation can no man lay. 4. That as Christ shall appear, so with him shall the interest of the second of new creation, appear with him in glory. 5. A postscript, or additional word to the reader, occasioned by the late revived noise of uniformity, or national conformity to the principles of some men.</title>
