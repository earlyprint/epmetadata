      <title>Wonderfull prophecies from the beginning of the monarchy of this land hidden vnder the parables of: Three young noble-men in a fiary fornace. A chast wife, and two old fornicators. The idol Belus and his dragon. Daniel in a den amid lyons. Their agreement with canonical prophecies: also in temperate defence of the apocryphals annexed to the canon of the Scriptures. Together with an essay touching the late prodigious comete; how farre forth the præsages thereof doe accord with such prophecies, as are found to pertaine to these our times. By all which, the discrete and wise in heart may gather touching things to come, what is forewarned vnto men; as for the general and publique, so also for their priuate and particular.
