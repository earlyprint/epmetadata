          <note>Observations: "1. Courage borne up, against the greatest discouragements. 2. Though the ingagement was fierce, yet the rage of the devourer was far beneath the mercy of our Deliverer, who gave them so great a victory without the loss of a man. 3. The victory was received by them, as it ought to be read by us, not without spirits raised high in thankfulness."</note>
