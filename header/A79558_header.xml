      <title>A compendious enchiridion touching most distempers incident to the body of man, with the best and easiest cures thereof Wherein the author desires the reader seriously to consider the particulars before censure be passed. [I]n all my travels with Salvator Winter, and many years after with that famous phisitian and chirurgeon John Ponteus; I never exacted on, or denied the poor my skill and medicines gratis, but still my house to them was as free as an hospital; the like never hath been performed but by your friend and neighbor John Church. [Ge]ntlemen take notice, that besides the old tract I gave you; I have now added for the good and benefit of my countrymen, a true way of making some cheap and necessary medicines; as balsomes, plaisters. Oyntments, diascordium and mithridate. [Wi]th the number of all the bones, veins,, [sic] muscles and arteries in the body of man.</title>
