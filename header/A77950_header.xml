      <title>A measure of the times: and a full &amp; clear description of the signes of the times, and of the changing of the times; and of the reign of Antichrist, who hath long reigned, and of his down-fall, which is at hand; and of the kingdom of Christ which is now setting up in the earth. Shewing unto all people in all nations, what the state of things hath been in ages past, and what the state of things are at this present day. ... And also, here it is manifest, concerning the teachers of this age, and the root from whence they sprang, who are manifest to be of that stock of false prophets, which Christ prophesied of should come, and which the Apostles saw was coming in their dayes, and how that the night of darknesse hath been upon all, for many generations: ... And also, the restauration is described, which shortly cometh, wherein Christ shall reign, whose right it is, and shall change laws and decrees, and the lamb shall be the light of all nations, ... and their King shall possesse the uttermost parts of the earth. By one who hath measured the times, who is come to the day that hath made all things manifest. Edw: Burrough.</title>
