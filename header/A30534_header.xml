      <title>A message proclaimed. By divine authority from the chosen assembly of the redeemed people in England, to the Pope (chief bishop) of Rome, and to his cardinals, Jesuits, and priests, and all other the officers of the Romish Church, where it shall meet with them through the world: that they may appear, and come forth to triall, and shew if they have the same faith, power, spirit, and authoritie, and government, as had the Apostles and true churches, before the apostacie: and this is a full invitation and challenge to the whole Church of Rome, and the beginning of controversie with her, for the perfect manifestation of the long hidden truth; betwixt them that are in the truth it self, and such as have the form, but not the power; that all things may be brought to light and true judgement. Written by an embassador for the true and living God, E.B.</title>
