      <title>The copies of several letters, which were delivered to the King being written by sundry friends in the truth, who wrote them as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, from sundry parts of the nation, though unknown one to another : all which being composed together, and having not wholly done their service unto several sober minded people in the nation who have desired to look into the things that were communicated by us to the king : it is therefore thought fit and convenient to publish them to the nation, being a work of the light, wrote by the movings of the Spirit of Truth, that the nation may see what visitations, instructions, warnings and tender invitations the King hath already had by and from the servants of the Lord, and such as with the peace and well governement of the nation.</title>
