          <note>Two letters. The first letter is to the Privy Council and dated 29 July 1599 at the end. The second letter is to Archbishop Whitgift, undated. Both letters refer to Broughton's "An epistle of an ebrew willinge to learne Christianity--Cf. STC.</note>
          <note>Title page plus A²  (first leaf signed Aij) chi¹ B⁴ C²  (British Library copy). Chi¹ to end has initial "u" (e.g. 'unto') and may have been printed by G. Thorp since the initial 'F' on C1v seems to be identical to that in STC 239. A²  has initial "v" (e.g. 'vnto') and also the same initial 'I' as in STC 3849, possibly printed in Amsterdam by by J. Theunisz. The title page has initial "v" twice and initial "u" twice--Cf. STC.</note>

          <note>Imperfect; tightly bound and trimmed, affecting text.</note>
