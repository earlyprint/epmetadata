      <title>The bios pantōn heideotos, or, [Hebrew] or the vision of eternity held forth, in answer to some antiquæries, vvhich were given forth from Ægypt by one of Babels builders, a pretended minister of Christ, living in Worcestershire at Beudly, that is called Mr. Henry Osland. But the quæries were given forth as the following papers declare, out of simplicity of heart, for satisfaction of the truth: but instead of giving a reasonable account to him that asks, he rails like a greedie hangman, ... So now the antiquæries are answered by one who ... is escaped out of Ægypt from the magicians ... Whose name is known to God by these three Jews letters in the sequel, [Hebrew] but to men by Iohn Humphryes.</title>
