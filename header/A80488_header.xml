      <title>The copie of a letter sent from the roaring boyes in Elizium; to the two arrant knights of the grape, in limbo, Alderman Abel and M. Kilvert, the two great projectors for wine: and to the rest of the worshipfull brotherhood of that patent. Brought over lately by Quart-pot, an ancient servant to Bacchus, whom for a long time they had most cruelly rackt, but hope shortly to be restored to his ancient liberties. Whereunto is added, the oration which Bacchus made to his subjects, in the lower world: published for the satisfaction and benefit of his subjects here.</title>
