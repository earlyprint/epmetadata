      <title>The forc'd marriage. Or, vnfortunate Celia. When old fools do a wooing go to those who are young-girls, they court their cruel foes, the old man sees he can't prevail with tongue, but finds t[h]at young ones, love to sport with young: he to the virgins parents makes redress, and doth the n[u]mber of his bags express; which takes away her fathers heart by stealth, he weds her not to him, but to his wealth. VVhich being done, she loaths his weak embraces, and throws herself on ruinous disgraces. Tune, Since Celia's my foe.</title>
