      <title>The wonder of Suffolk: being a true relation of one that reports he made a league with the devil for three years to do mischief; and now breaks open houses, robs people daily, destroys cattel before the owners faces, strips women naked, &amp;c. and can neither be shot nor taken; but leaps over walls fifteen foot high, runs five or six miles in a quarter of an hour, and sometimes vanishes in the midst of multitudes that go to take him. Faithfully written in a letter from a sober person, dead not long since, to a friend in Ship-yard near Temple-Bar, and ready to be attested by hundreds that have been spectatoes of, or sufferers by his exploits, in several parts of Suffolk. With allowance.</title>
