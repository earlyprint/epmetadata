      <title>A distinction between the new covenant and the old and how that in the old covenant the Jews priests lips were to preserve the Jews peoples knowledge: but in the new and everlasting covenant Christ the high-priest, is the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, and he filleth the earth with the knowledge of the Lord God; and the earth being full of the knowledge of the Lord God, then there is no want of it in the eath. And Christ the high-priest, he doth not only fill the earth with knowledge of the Lord God, but covereth the earth with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters do the sea; so the earth shall not be seen. So then it may be seen, that the substance in the new covenant is far beyond the figure in the old covenant. Read, hear, see, perceive and understand, receive and possess.</title>
