Being a true relation of a cloath worker, dweelling [sic] in Thames-street who was wished by an old woman to a maid near Pauls church-yard, perswading him she had money at use, being a meer plot of the maiden and she to cheat him of his money, knowing him to be none of the wisest, cheated him of forty pound.
