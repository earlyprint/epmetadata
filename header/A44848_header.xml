      <title>Truth cleared, and the deceit made manifest or, An answer to a printed paper wherein are certaine untruths and false aspersions, cast upon a people, called Quakers, by some members of the church of Wrexham in Wales. With some questions answered: with other false accusations cast upon us, by one whose name is subscribed in print, Mr. Vavasor Powel, who is one of the chief priests of Wales, being in the generation of the scribes and pharisees. Let him that reads understand and he shall see it so. And likewise an answer to other slanders and false reports upon the same people, whom reproachfully they call Quakers, but we rather chuse to suffer reproaches, slanders, and false reports with the people of God, then to deny the power of God made manifest in us. By his servant who seeks the freedoms of Israels children, after the spirit, whom the world calls. Rich. Hubberthorn.</title>
