      <title>A Sad caveat to all Quakers. Not to boast any more that they have God Almighty by the hand, when they have the devil by the toe. Containing a true narration of one William Pool an apprentice, &amp; a known Quaker neer Worcester, who on Friday, in last Febr. the 20. boasting that he had that day Christ by the hand, and must according to appointment go to him again, did on that evening by the temptation and impulsion of the devil drown himself in the river. Together with the judgement of the coroner and jury, who found him guilty of self-murder. As also the most barbarous usage of some Quakers who digged him out of his grave. And the most unparaleled presumption of one Mrs. Susan Peirson, who undertook to raise him again to life, with the whole manner of it, and the words that at that time she uttered; the like whereof never heard in Christendome.</title>
