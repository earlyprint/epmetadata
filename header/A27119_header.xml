      <title>An arrow shot against Babylon out of Josephs bow which grew up from the stem of Jesse ... and this is a visitation and warning (once more) from God unto all such rulers, teachers, and people in England who are, or may be persecutors about religion and worship that they may yet flee out of Babylon ... the great whore (which hath set upon nations and reigned over the kings of the earth) that they may partake no longer of her sins ... and this may serve as a glass for all false Christendom to behold themselves ... / by William Bayly.</title>
