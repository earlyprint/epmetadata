      <title>The sector on a quadrant, or A treatise containing the description and use of four several quadrants two small ones and two great ones, each rendred many wayes, both general and particular. Each of them accomodated for dyalling; for the resolving of all proportions instrumentally; and for the ready finding the hour and azimuth universally in the equal limbe. Of great use to seamen and practitioners in the mathematicks. Written by John Collins accountant philomath. Also An appendix touching reflected dyalling from a glass placed at any reclination.</title>
