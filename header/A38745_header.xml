      <title>Glad tidings of the everlasting Gospel, and doctrine of eternal life With many things profitable for edification to them that fear God; but chiefly exhortations to all that thirst after the waters of life, to prepare and make ready to meet the Lord Jesus Christ, and wait for his coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, according to his word. Let no one despise the day of small things, for the Lord hath hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed to babes and sucklings; he hath chosen the base and contemptible things of the world to confound the things that are high and mighty, and calleth those things which are not, as though they were. Ye saints of the most high God, lift up your heads, for the time of your redemption is nigh, even come, for the signe of the Son of man hath already appeared in the clouds of heaven, which is an infallible token of Sions deliverance. Published and declared (in love to them that mourn in Sion) by an unworthy servant of Jesus Christ, to whom it is revealed to be the least of all saints, John Erlam.</title>
